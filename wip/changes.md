_an erotic tale by Transgirl_

## Chapter One
My childhood was in no way out of the ordinary and my family was a stable,
loving one. So that cannot be the explanation for me becoming who I am today.
My parents didn't even know what I was doing, sometimes right under their
noses. I think it was partially the risk of getting caught what made it so
attractive to me and why it escalated so quickly.

I was twelve when I first heard about it at school, sure my mother had given me
_the_ talk, but it was during the biology lessons I really learned what it
entailed. A few months later, the day after my thirteenth birthday, I basically
convinced a friend to try it out. We were alone at his house and with all the
stumbling around of not knowing what we were doing, I did loose my virginity.
Even if it just lasted barely a minute.

By the time I was 14 I had done it multiple times and the more I did the more I
liked it. At the age of 16 I was having sex at least two or three times a
month, I was literally the girl who did it with the football team. One day,
under the title of tutoring, the quarterback came to my house and we ended up
in my bed while both my parents were downstairs.

In college it didn't get any better, in stead of slowing down I got worse. They
called me all kinds of names but I just didn't care.
