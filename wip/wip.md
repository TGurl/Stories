# Being Shared
*an erotic tale by Transgirl*

## Chapter One
All I can say is that I wasn't born this way and absolutely not raised this
way, the changes were hardly noticeable and they all added up until I was where
I am today. Not that I'm complaining, it's who I am today and I am perfectly
fine with it. To enable our lifestyle and not be in constant fear of being
molested we even moved to another country, which brought us more than just the
ability to be who we truly are.

We now live just outside a small town in the middle of The Netherlands where
we were able to buy an old farm including the surrounding land. The property is
totally surrounded by woods and we got permission to put up a 7ft fence just as
long as it blended in with the environment. It took us a while to find someone
who could create one that looked as natural as possible and we ultimately got
permission from the council to put it up. Now when you walk through the woods
you don't even see a fence until you're right on top of it, giving us total
privacy.

We totally renovated the old farmhouse and barns into the property of our
dreams. As it is located on a very small street leading to practically nowhere
it is also very quiet most of the time. Only traffic that really needs to be
there or sometimes people who are just cruising use that road. And our house is
almost 82 feet from that road, so even in front of the property we have some
sort of privacy. We didn't get permission to put up a fence there, but that's
okay as it now is a very beautiful garden and my pride and joy. I never would
have thought gardening would give me so much satisfaction.

There were a few more barns on the property, which mostly were torn down or
renovated to guest quarters and an office for us. It's nice not to have to
work in the house itself, to have a detached building for that purpose. It
makes us feel like we still are going to work instead of just moving to another
room. "I'm off to work," is now one of our most favorite things to do. For fun
we even listen to the traffic report and if it's bad we jokingly say "Better
get going then."

One day my husband just stood in the middle of our property. When I was about
to ask him why he called me saying "Oh man, traffic is a mess. I think I going
to be late. Oh wait, we started moving again. I love you. Bye." I burst into
laughter and shook my head. He turned his head to me, stuck his tongue out and
disappeared into the office.

I do have to say moving to The Netherlands was one of the best decisions we
ever made. Not only is it very beautiful here, it's also safe and well
organized. Doing what I am doing it's so nice to know that our medical bills
are covered and we will never see bills we can't pay. Medical debt isn't a
thing here. And don't get me started about guns. I never knew what freedom
truly meant until we moved here. In the US I was always on the lookout where I
could hide in case of a shooter, that's not necessary here because it simply
doesn't happen.

We experienced some sort of PTSD the first few months we lived here and some
say we still do. And maybe they're right, I sometimes catch myself flinching
whenever there is a loud bang. I like to believe it's gotten a lot better
though.

We've been living here for over six years now and we've decided to never go
back. Sure it's not easy leaving friends and family behind, but the truth of
the matter is that when they came over for a visit they too experienced the
same things we did. It made us chuckle when we sat outside a small cafe in the
center of town our friends ducked when a car misfired. "Americans?" the people
at the next table asked. We just nodded and said "Yes. We are too, but we live
here now."

But all of that is about how it is now. Before I tell more about that I have
to tell you how it all began. That's important for you to understand 

a. Why we do what we do.
b. Why we moved to another country.

I simply can't explain it any other way and trust me I tried. This isn't the
first draft of this story, I've tried many other ways to get it onto paper, or
my computer that is. Could I have done a better job? I am sure I could have,
but I'm not a professional writer and this is my best attempt on writing it all
down. I've read quite a few stories from couples enjoying this lifestyle and I
wanted to share ours.

To protect the identities of everyone involved, including ours, I have changed
names and locations where it all took place. In some cases I've used names that
don't even exist, the college we went to for example. But I promise the rest of
it is all true, the events that took place did happen as I will write them
down.

So let's start at the beginning.

## Chapter Two
I was so nervous the day I got to hear whether I had graduated or not. I waited
for hours for the phone to ring and when it finally did my heart skipped a
beat. "Laura?" the voice of my favorite teacher said on the other side of he
line, "I've got good news --" That's all I needed to hear, I started screaming,
yelling, jumping and when I calmed down and went back to the phone I could hear
her laughing. "Laura? Are you there?"

"Yes Miss Johnson, I am here."

"Good. Yes, you passed. But did you really think there was a chance you
didn't?"

"Always Miss, always. Thank you so much for calling."

"No worries, have a nice day now and see you at graduation." she said.

I threw down the phone and jumped into my mothers arms. "I passed!" I shouted,
"I passed!" We both were happy and called my father as soon as we both calmed
down. I took a deep breath, dialed the number and waited for him to pick up.

"Did they call?" he somehow knew it was us.

"Yes, they did." I said with a trembling voice. My mother looked at me with a
face saying 'what are you doing?'.

"Oh baby, and what did they say?"

"Well, Miss Johnson called." I kept up the tremble as if I was about to start
crying, "And she was very nice and all. But -- I PASSED! Dad, I am graduating!
I'm going to college!"

"I knew it!" he said, "I just knew it! Oh sweetie, I'm coming home early this
afternoon, we are going to celebrate." During dinner that evening he couldn't
stop telling everybody that I passed, he was so proud of me. Now, it's
important for you to understand that we weren't rich people, nor were we poor.
My dad had to work hard to get where he was and me going to college was the
crown on his achievement. I was an only child as my mother wasn't able to have
children after me. The fact that I even existed was kind of a miracle for them.

That should explain why the were so protective of me, not overbearing but still
protective. I was raised to be a good girl on old fashioned values, but still
strong and independent too. On top of that we lived in a very small town where
almost everybody knew each other. Therefor being different was frowned upon and
as I didn't know any different I fell into that mold too.

Going to college was eye opening in that aspect. Suddenly I was confronted with
people who had different thoughts and ideals. At first I was defensive as I
wanted to preserve the old-fashioned way of life. What was so wrong with
getting married and start a family? It wasn't like I condemned sex before
marriage, I just chose otherwise.

That all changed when my room mate decided to change colleges, she wanted to
live closer to home and not, like me, be on the other side of the country.
After being alone for a few months I got assigned a new room mate as mine was
the only room available for her. At first we didn't get along that well, she
was the total opposite of me. Where I was an introvert, and still am, she was
an extrovert. And she had her tongue on her sleeve, she just said how she felt
whether you liked it or not.

Slowly I started to respect her for that, she simply didn't care what anyone
thought. "Why should I?", she once told me, "If I had to take what everyone
thinks about me, I wouldn't get anything done. There's always someone who is
offended or disagrees with whatever it is you do, wear or say. As long as you
think it's right for you, why should you care about what anybody thinks. It's
your life, not theirs."

"But aren't you scared you are offending someone?" I asked her.

"As long as I don't care about them, no. I care what the people close to me
think and those are the ones I listen to. Not some random person on the street
or the internet. God, that would make life so hard."

Those words made me rethink some thing I had been taught and I had to conclude
she was right. In a small town it is doable to adhere to unwritten rules, in a
city the size of where my college was not so much. There were millions of
people living there and there were just as many opinions. How could I take all
of those into account? I simply couldn't. So why should I change anything I
wanted to do or wear? If I wanted to wear a dress with pentagrams all over it,
why couldn't I? I wasn't religious and if you didn't like it you could always
look the other way.

Over the years I was in college the way I dressed changed, from rather
conservative and modest to outspoken and the latest fashion. I toned it down
whenever I went back home, but still it was quite different from what people
were used to. My mother loved it though, she thought I looked beautiful.

In the third year of college more had changed, my thoughts on marriage. It no
longer was the ultimate goal for me. Not that I didn't want to get married
anymore, it just wasn't a goal anymore. Being single, moving in together or
getting married, it all was fine with me. That also meant my ideas about sex
had changed. I can still remember how I felt after the first one-night-stand, I
was elated and felt freed. Released from the shackles I had put on myself.

I went through a period where I had multiple *encounters* a week. Even Marisha,
my room mate, thought I went off the reservation during that time. I just
couldn't get enough of it. A night I had some sort of regret after was when I
went home with a couple of boys and spent the night as their toy. That was the
moment I knew I had gone too far and I needed to reel it back in. Luckily those
weren't college boys and the only one who knew was Marisha.

During my last year I met Travis, now my husband. We started dating and because
he had gone through some relationships before me, he wanted to take it slow.
That might be the main reason why when he proposed I said yes. We had taken our
time to get to know each other, to trust each other and more importantly to be
totally honest with each other. He didn't judge me when I told him about my
*promiscuous* period. "That's a phase you had to go through", he said when I
had told him, "I do believe you when you tell me that's over now."

After we got married we moved into a small apartment downtown. With only one
bedroom and an open kitchen it was our little kingdom, our slice of heaven. He
got a nice job and I worked mostly from home for a company that published
books for children. As an English major that was the only job I could land,
besides teaching. Editing books wasn't my favorite thing to do, but it was a
job and someone had to do it.

At first working from home was ideal for me, not having to spend hours in a day
stuck in traffic was my idea of the ideal job. But as soon as the runt set it,
it became rather isolating. I only knew my colleagues from the screen and I
started to miss the physical interaction of being in an office. Besides that
the work I was doing wasn't why I had gone to college and get a business
degree. I had always dreamed of either working for a large company as some sort
of manager or to start my own little company.

It didn't take me long, maybe three years, to conclude this wasn't it for me
and after talking to Travis I decided to quit. I simply had enough. By that
time Travis had been promoted twice and we moved into a more luxury apartment
just outside of the city center. I was a housewife for a while until that
started to bore me too. The apartment wasn't that big and cleaning it didn't
take all day. Nor did the laundry and anything else you do. To make a long
story short I started to follow my dream of having my own business.

As it was the easiest way I started selling clothes online, mostly women's
clothing. I bought up stock from failing businesses and sold them for a small
profit online. There were many times our apartment was filled with boxes and
boxes of goods. I was packing and sending those out for days on end, until I
was finally convinced of renting a space somewhere. It so happened that one day
I got hold off clothing meant for the *adult* market. I simply couldn't believe
how quick those went out the door again.

I started buying and selling more of those until I finally stopped selling
*regular* clothes all together. I sold everything, from lingerie to latex
suits, even some BDSM related things like masks, gags and collars. Then I
started selling toys too.

As I couldn't do this through the site I had been using I hired a company to
design and host my new website. I also changed the name of the company to
*Sexy4Less*. And it skyrocketed from there. I had to move offices as we needed
more space for our stock and more space to package it all, I even had to buy
two vans so we could ship everything. Suddenly I was the CEO of a small
company and instead of selling second hand I made deals with companies
overseas. All in all the main goal was to be cheaper than anyone else, a goal
we succeeded in most of the time.

Setting up the company took most of my time and as Travis was working long
hours too we started to drift apart. To counter this we implemented date-night,
every Friday we went to dinner and after to a movie or a bar. As Travis never
had been the dancing type I would dance with random men who were there. At
first I kept my distance, but at some point I allowed them to put their arms
around me for a slow dance. At no point Travis showed signs of jealousy, he
seemed to enjoy it rather.

One evening when we drove home he bluntly asked me "Did you want to kiss him?"

I felt a little offended by that question and responded "Why would you even ask
that?"

"Just by the way you looked at him. Did you find him attractive?"

"What?! No, I didn't find him attractive. He was a good dancer and it was a
beautiful song, that's all."

"If you say so." he replied and the discussion was over. But it started me
thinking whether Travis had been right. I started to question myself because if
I was honest with myself I had felt attracted to that man. I just hadn't
realized until Travis brought it up. At that moment I was never going to admit
that to him as it was just wrong. It wasn't they way I was raised and it went
against everything I thought was right.

For the rest of the week my business took my mind of things only to return with
a vengeance when I stopped working that Friday. As I sat at home I couldn't
stop thinking about it. Subconsciously I dressed a little nicer that evening.
When I got out of the bedroom Travis even noticed and said "Wow, are you going
to seduce someone tonight?"

"Just the man I love," I replied with a smile.

After having dinner at our favorite restaurant we ended up in a club. It had
just opened and as Travis knew the owner we had been invited to come that
evening. The music was thumping and I could feel the bass in my stomach. The
dance floor was filled with people. To the right was a double door leading to
another bar area where the music was less loud, but the dance floor was the
main one. Travis went over to the bar to order us something to drink.

I was glad we had decided to take a taxi when we left home. We just stood there
for a moment taking it all in. "It's very beautiful," I said, "I like it here."
Travis nodded and took a sip from his beer. I had a white wine in my hands and
just looked around, slightly moving to the music.

My dress was rather low cut, in the back as well as in the front showing some
of my boobs. What Body-Glue isn't good for, I thought as I was slightly
dancing. I had to glue the front as it was rather loose and of course I didn't
want it to slide. The skirt itself was tight around my hips and ass. On my feet
I work 6 inch heels, which made my legs look beautiful I thought and by the
reaction men gave me I was right in thinking that. My hair was in a ponytail
with two strands on both sides of my face, two long earrings completed the
look.

Dressing like this always made me feel good about myself and more confident. As
we were standing there, every now and again talking loud to beat the volume of
the music a man came walking up to us. I took a sip from my wine and we started
talking.

"Hi, you're looking beautiful," the man said.

"And who are you?" I replied.

Travis interrupted "That's Shawn, he owns the place."

"Ah, nice to meet you. Do you normally tell women they are beautiful and does
it ever work?" I said to Shawn.

"Well, I don't know. The first time I said it. So I would have to ask you
whether it worked."

"I don't know," I replied, "Jury is not out yet."

"Ah, well then we will have to wait a little longer." He turned to Travis, "How
are you doing, Travis? Still working at the same place?"

"Yes, and thank you for the invite. There's quite the queue outside and it was
nice to be able to skip it."

"Anything for an old friend. Did he tell you we went to college together?" he
then said to me.

"Is that so? And which college would that be?" I replied.

"Oh Kingston," he said with sort of an air over him.

"Kingston? Than we went to the same college too. That's were we met, Travis and
I. So I'm wondering why didn't I see you there as Travis and I were in the same
year and I'm sure I would have seen you at least once in those four years."

"Oh, but you did. I was a little fatter back then, glasses and longer hair."

"You were that Shawn?"

"Yes, I am not afraid to admit it. I started exercising after college, eating
better and now here I am."

"You cleaned up nicely," I laughed. By that time my glass was empty and Shawn
offered to get us another round.

"If you want to dance with him, go ahead," Travis whispered in my ear. I just
looked at him a little confused. It wasn't what he said it was more the way he
said it. Sure Shawn was rather handsome now and his body looked nice, above all
he smelled great. Shawn returned with our drinks and as he handed me my wine he
had this look on his face. I could see his eyes going down to my chest and it
felt somehow nice to see him do it.

When he looked up again I just smiled at him and I might even have winked. I
don't really remember, but according to Travis I did. I finished my drink and
that's when Shawn asked me to dance, he held out his hand and I put mine in
his. He guided me to the floor where we danced. The DJ was playing some popular
music with heavy beats, this was when dance was popular. I had a lot of fun and
was so happy that I had used glue to keep my top to where it was supposed to
be.

Song after song was played and slowly the DJ changed into slower songs ending
with a ballad. Shawn put his arms around me and I put mine over his shoulders,
he was bigger than me but I didn't feel like I had to reach. During the song we
moved further to the middle of the dance floor. To a point where I couldn't see
Travis anymore. His hand went up to my naked back and feeling him touch me
there sent all kinds of sensations through my body. I was shocked by what I
felt, but didn't move away. His hand went up and down my back giving me
goosebumps all over.

He bent his head forward and just as our lips were about to touch, I turned my
head away. "No", I panted, "I can't do this." Pushing his arms away I took a
few steps back, looked at him for a moment and walked away. I saw Travis
sitting at the bar and simply said "We have to go." He asked me why and I
repeated what I had said. He got up, took my arm and we left.

At the house I told him what had happened but left out how I felt. He didn't
get angry or jealous, not at all. It was almost the opposite, he looked like he
enjoyed me talking about it. I was angry at first, at myself, at Travis. How
could he think of me like that?

"Tell me why you dressed the way you did?" He asked after we were quiet for a
while.

"Because I like it. It's a nice dress and it makes me look good." I replied

"That it is and it does make you look good. But -- you could have worn that new
dress you bought the other day. You know, the light one. But you didn't, you
chose this one. Why?"

"Oh, I don't know. I didn't feel like light salmon colors."

"Or wasn't it sexy enough for you? I mean this is all open in front and in the
back. You've only worn this one once before, when we went to the opening of
that musical, remember?"

"Yes, Les Miserables. A friend worked on the crew and she had gotten some
tickets to spare. She knew how much I wanted to see it and she gave them to
us. And it's called a premiere dear, not an opening."

"Whatever. All the women there were dressed like this, so why did you choose to
wear it tonight? It wasn't special and I would loved to have seen you in that
new one. To be perfectly honest, I don't really care what you wear, you look
beautiful in anything to me. So why did you choose this dress?"

I refused to talk about it any longer, this was getting crazy. Was he really
suggesting I put it on to seduce someone? To see men gawk at me as if I was
nothing more than a piece of meat? I felt betrayed, hurt and dirty.

I ran upstairs to our bedroom, took off that dress and changed into my
sweatshirt and a pair of yoga pants. I sat at my vanity taking out my earrings
and was about to start removing my makeup. I was so near crying than I almost
messed up and cleaned my face with nail polish remover. I put my head on my
arms and started to cry. That's when Travis walked in.

"Don't cry," he said softly, "Pleas don't cry. I wasn't trying to hurt you."

"You did," I sobbed, "You did. How can you think that off me? I am a loyal
wife, we took our vows and that means something to me."

"I know and it means a lot to me too. But Laura, you have to be honest with
yourself. It's the little things I see and it all leads op to one thing."

"And that is?"

"You like the attention you get. The first time I noticed I thought I had seen
it wrong. Then I noticed it again and again. I didn't say anything because I
don't care. I know that in the end you will be next to me in that bed." with
his head he gestured towards our bed. He was quiet for a moment before he said
"I like it when you unknowingly flirt with a guy. Flinging your hair, the
little gestures with your head, putting an extra bounce in your step, arcing
your back just a little more and most of all swaying your hips when you know
someone is walking behind us. It's those little things."

I just couldn't believe him. He was basically saying that I was flirting with
men right in front of him. For what? To make him jealous? I already knew he
wasn't the jealous type. He had proven that to me on multiple occasions. So why
then? Why would I do such a thing?

"So tell me," Travis said softly again, "Why did we have to leave all of a
sudden? You were on the dance floor and I couldn't see you anymore. So what
happened?"

"We were dancing to that slow song, he had his arms around me and then tried to
kiss me. I pushed him away and that was it. I wanted to leave."

"But the question is, and be honest now, did you want to kiss him?"

I felt a shock through my system. I felt myself turning white as if I was
caught doing something bad. I did want to kiss him, there was no other way
about it. I bowed my head and whispered "Maybe."

"Sorry, I didn't hear that," Travis said, "Did you say maybe?"

"I don't know," I huffed. Travis poked my arm a little to coach it out of me
then I just blurted it out "Yes, I wanted to kiss him. Your wife wanted to kiss
another man. There you have it. Are you happy now?"

"Yes, you are being honest now. Not just to me, but to yourself too."

I just stared at him and felt deflated, defeated and just empty. The secret was
out it felt like. And there he was, on his knees next to me: my loving husband
with his kind eyes looking at me. No sign of anger or jealousy, but warm eyes
and a slight smile as if to say I hadn't done anything wrong in his eyes. I put
my arms around him and started to cry again.

"I am so sorry," I cried, "I am so sorry. I won't ever do it again. I will not
dance with anyone ever again. I promise. I love you so much and I never want to
hurt you."

"I love you too, Laura. And you didn't hurt me, not even for a little bit.
Seeing you dance with another man makes me feel proud. Whenever you dance with
someone I thing *you get this dance man, but she's coming home with me*. It
makes me feel so proud that I can call you my wife. It makes me love you even
more."

"Do you mean that?" I said through my tears.

He nodded and said "Yes, I do. I want to give you all the space to be you, the
woman I fell in love with. The woman who doesn't care what other people think
and I am so grateful to Marisha that she taught you that."

"You are?"

"Oh yes. And I've heard all the stories about you in college. They told me you
were easy and suddenly that stopped. I've never asked you why because I felt
like you would tell me when you where ready and I still feel that way. I don't
care about your past, what you did before we met. I care about our past, our
current and our future, the ones we share. All I want is for you to be happy,
that's the most important thing for me."

I felt a wave, a tsunami of love coming my way. He had never made me *feel* his
love like he did at that moment. Of course he had heard about my *wild* period,
we were in the same year in college. And we didn't go to the biggest of them
and thus it would have been strange if he hadn't heard. And still he wanted to
meet me, get to know me, take it slow. Right after I stopped being that wild
girl I had been worried nobody would want to be with me just for me, Travis
proved me wrong. That was one of the many things I fell for.

"It was a Saturday and I wanted to go out, but Marisha had to study. So I went
alone, to Malone's. You know it, that one in Old Town. Well, I was dancing,
having fun and some guy chatted me up. We kissed, made out and then he invited
me over to his place. It wasn't that far and I felt a little special." I looked
at Travis and noticed he seemed to like hearing my story. Past boyfriends
didn't want to hear about the ones who went before them.

I took his hand and we sat down on the bed. I looked him in the eyes and said
"Well, we reach his apartment and when he opened the door there were about five
more guys inside. They handed me a bottle of vodka and I took a sip and another
and another. I started to kiss that guy from the bar again and he started to
undress me. I didn't protest and even helped him with my bra. We ended up in
the bed and remember the others were watching us. One might even have been
recording it, I don't really remember."

"Keep going," Travis said, "Tell me all the details. Get it out your system."

"I haven't told anyone this. Not a soul. That being recorded might have been in
my mind because I never come across any video of it at all, never. But I'm
still scared it will pop up somewhere. Back to the story. As I was saying we
were on that bed, I was fully naked by now, bent over and --"

"Go on say it. Tell me everything."

"I was -- I had his -- You know."

"No, tell me you had is what?"

"I had his penis in my mouth, alright? I was sucking his cock. I was bent over
with my ass towards the guys watching, the could see everything and I didn't
care at that moment. I lost myself and before I realized what was happening I
had five cocks around me and one inside me. One of them bent me over and pushed
it up my ass. I can still feel the pain. I screamed that he was hurting me, but
I just couldn't stop. I had sex with all of them, all night long. They came
everywhere, all over my body, inside my pussy and my ass. I was more than happy
to be their toy that night. When I woke up I felt dirty, used and taken
advantage off. I had crossed a line I wasn't ready for. So I got dressed and
got the heck out of there. Hours later I learned they were groomers, getting
girls ready for prostitution and this had been the initiation night. I had been
lucky to get out of there. Maybe because I was willing they didn't feel the
need to drug me or lock the door. As I said I had been extremely lucky. Weeks
later they all were arrested and 14 girls were rescued. They had been locked up
in the basement of that building and nobody even knew they were there."

"I think I read about that. Yes, I remember that. It was awful."

"Yes, that's what made me realize what I was doing. I was selling myself short
and I knew if I continued with what I was doing it could end up real bad. So I
stopped. Maybe it helped that I had done enough of it. Maybe it was some sort
of catching up. Before I went to college I truly believed in saving myself for
marriage. Until then I had never been with a boy before. But talking to Marisha
made me change my mind and I am still grateful. Everything that happened after
wasn't here fault. She even did her best to make me stop. She really did, but
the cork was out and once I started to like it, I *really* liked it."

Travis snickered and said "You can say that again. So tell me, who was the one
who got to get your virginity?"

"Oh, that was Angelo. It all went so natural. We were in his room because his
room mate was out of town. We kissed, made out and I told him I was a virgin.
He was so gentle and took his time with me. I was so nervous but I felt that I
was ready. Then all of a sudden it really happened. He got on top of me and I
was so scared. But again he took is time, slowly stretching me before he pushed
on. I can feel the sharp pain as I am thinking about it. When he was inside he
just stayed there for a minute or two so I could adjust. Then he started to
move, slide in and out ever so slow. The pain was replaced with pleasure and I
placed my hands on his hips, I curled my legs around him and he started to move
faster and faster. I came before I knew it. When it was over he had come on my
belly and I felt like a real woman for the first time in my life. No longer a
girl, no longer a virgin, a real woman."

"What happened after?"

"Well, we saw the blood on the sheets and I got scared again. We looked it up
in the books of his room mate, a medical student, and we learned that it was
normal for a woman to bleed a little at the first time. We put the book back
and I pushed him on the bed. I got on top of him and took his half hard penis
inside me again. I felt him getting hard inside me and it made me so horny. I
had broken my own vow and I wanted more. I wanted to go all the way and when he
was about to come again I pushed myself down on him, forcing him to come inside
me. I wanted it all, I needed it all. The weeks after were the most scary in my
life, yes I was on birth control but I knew all too well that it wasn't 100%
guaranteed. So when I finally got my period I was so happy and elated. Marisha
and I bought a jumbo package of condoms and I must have been to one that used
them all, or at least most of them. I never did it without, never. Until that
night I told you about. As I said I lost myself, didn't really know what I was
doing. It just went from one thing to the other."

"Wow, that's quite the story," Travis said, "So Angelo kissed you. Like this?"

He kissed me and I nodded. "And like this," I replied and kissed him. Slowly we
reenacted my first time. Ever move was commented with a "like this" "Then he
got on top of me and I felt his cock against my vulva, he kept it there for a
while slowly going up and down my labia, just like that yes." When Travis
slowly pushed forward I let go of a little shriek, just like I did back then.
It was the best feeling in the world I had, I was telling my husband how I lost
my virginity in all it's details and he acted them out with me. It seemed to
turn him on a lot and I am sure he got harder than he had ever been before. And
when he finally exploded over my belly I am so sure I hadn't seen him come so
hard before.

Afterwards we laughed and giggled, kissed and made out. We feel asleep in each
others arms and I felt more connected to him than I had ever felt before. He
was the one I had no more secrets for, he knew them all even the one of one of
the worst nights in my life, the one I had been so lucky to have escaped from.

## Chapter Three
In the weeks after that night I felt like a weight had been lifted of my
shoulders and it was like Travis loved me even more now. He bought me flowers,
jewelry and just pampered me with gifts. I had to tell him to stop doing that,
that him just being with me was more than enough. He just wanted me to know
that he still loved me, he said and I told him that I did.

I had just moved into the *adult* side of selling clothes and was exploring the
toys that were available. Seeing all those things all day had made me curious
about them and when I was all alone in that office one night after the first
shipment had come in I realized they had sent me a few too many. It was normal
for me to be there late because of the time difference between us and the
factory. I called them to check if they had made a mistake and they said no.
"It's normal for us to send some samples with each shipment, we usually send an
extra two or three." the woman said in broken English.

When I got home I went upstairs to our bedroom and got out what I had brought:
four dildos in different sizes, from small to extra large. I laid them on the
bed and just stared at them. When I heard Travis come home I put them back in
my bag and shoved them in my wardrobe, the last place he would look I thought.
I quickly undressed and threw a shirt and pair of yoga pants on the bed.
"Laura?" I could hear him shout. "Over here," I shouted back, "just changing. I
had to get out of those clothes."

He came up and just as he walked in I was putting on my pants. He put his arms
around me from the back and said "Maybe you should change into something else.
I want to take you out to dinner."

"But it's not even Friday," I replied.

"I know," he said, "I just want to go out. I feel like it."

"Okay, where are we going?"

"That will be a surprise."

"What should I wear?"

"Why don't you put on that dress you did when we went to the club. I promise
you it will be alright."

It took me an hour to get ready and when I was I saw Travis was wearing his
best suit. He looked so smart in it. We got in the car and drove for another
hour or so. It was almost ten when we arrived at our destination, an
establishment called *Rosa Mundo*. "What is this?" I asked him.

"You will see," was all he said with that slight smirk in his face.

Travis rang the doorbell and a small panel opened in the door. "Hi, Davis. We
called earlier." It took a moment for the door was opened and I was really
questioning what we were getting ourselves into. "After you," Travis said and I
stepped in the door. We were in a small hallway and the man closed the door
behind us.

"Welcome to Rosa Mundo. Please fill in this form and sign it. This is just to
guarantee all visitors are discreet about what they will see and who they will
encounter inside. Everything that happens in Rosa Mundo, stays in Rosa Mundo.
That's our motto. As we have agreed on the price and all has been payed for all
you have to do is have a good time. My name is Tiago and once you step through
that door anything is possible and anything can happen. It's all up to you."

I became quite nervous but Travis' smile reassured me a little. We went through
the door and stepped into a very nice bar. Lots of reds and pinks everywhere
without getting tacky. It was so tastefully done. On the walls were paintings
of women in all states of nakedness, they were more works of art that belonged
in a museum than anything else. Behind the bar and older woman welcomed us with
a warm and kind voice. "Welcome, welcome, so nice you are here. Please sit down
anywhere and tell me what you want."

I was quite hungry and saw the buffet along the wall. "I might get some of
that," I said.

"Please do," the woman said, "We've got pasta over here, some nachos here and
this one I like the most Chicken Piri-Piri, a traditional Portuguese dish.
Lovely with some fries and extra sauce. Feel free to get whatever you want. Can
I get you something to go with that. A nice wine, perhaps?"

"That would be lovely," I replied as I put some food on a plate.

"Eat as much as you want," the woman said, "We've got more where that came from
and it will be there all night."

We sat down at a table and I asked Travis "What is this place? And how did you
find it?"

"This is the place of our dreams," he said, "And I found it on accident.
Remember that meeting I talked about? The important one? Well, I left the
office a little early and ran into some road works. No biggie I thought, just a
left turn, then a right and another right. Boy was I wrong. So I stopped to set
the GPS and I parked right here. I saw the sign and looked it up on my phone. I
read what they were offering and couldn't stop thinking about it. So today I
just called them and here we are. I took the day off and you might better call
in sick tomorrow, it might be a long night."

"I can't do that," I replied, "We can stay here for a few hours and go home
around midnight or an hour later. That way I can still get my sleep."

"We'll see. If either of us doesn't like it we can do that, okay?" I nodded and
took a bite of the chicken. It was simply delicious. The woman brought our wine
and said "My name is Ana and together with my husband you met earlier we run
this place. I hope it all is well?"

"It's delicious," I answered, "Thank you Ana. I'm Laura and this is my husband
Travis."

"So nice to hear that. I do hope you will like it here, the entertainment area
will open in about an hour. Until then enjoy your meal and as I said there is
more than enough, so please eat as much as you want to. That is the Portuguese
way."

She walked away and we had a lovely dinner together listening to the Portuguese
music in the background. More people came in and everybody was wearing their
best and nicest clothes. They all greeted us and we smiled back at them. Travis
got himself some more food and I sat there looking around to take it all in.
Somehow it all felt so comfortable, more like a family gathering than a bunch
of strangers in a restaurant.

Tiago opened the doors in the back of the bar and a large room became visible.
He pushed a few switched and the lights turned on. I saw tables and chairs
around a dance floor. On the far end a DJ booth and scattered around were some
platforms. All painted in the same tasteful mix of reds and pinks as the bar we
were in. Tiago walked inside and did something I couldn't see, suddenly there
was music coming from that room and the music in the bar changed to the same
that was playing there, but at a lower volume.

Ana shouted "The entertainment room is open. Please feel free to enter at your
leisure. The bar will still be open." Some of the people standing in the bar
went in and sat down at the available tables. When Travis was finished we got
ourselves another round of drinks and went inside too. There were a few people
dancing already and it all started out calmly. We sat down at a table to the
right of the floor and looked at the people dancing. As time went on the music
got a little faster until Tiago was playing music from the 80s and 90s, all the
popular songs came by.

I was swaying on my chair when a man approached me and asked me for a dance.
Without thinking I accepted and he took me on the dance floor. Tiago was
playing "I'm coming out" by Dianna Ross and I thought how to the point it felt
to be playing that song at that moment. That song was followed by another disco
hit and then another. Ever so slow the party started. I had been dancing for
quite a while when I sat down again. I was smiling from ear to ear and so was
Travis. He got us another round of drinks and as he was doing so another man
invited me onto the dance floor. As I walked up I could see people kissing and
making out all along the dance floor. It was like being in high school all over
again, but this time I wasn't the one leaning against the wall.

I didn't think much about it until I saw a woman kissing a man and I was sure
she had been kissing someone else just minutes before. Then I noticed couples
retreating into another room, one hidden by thick rubber sheets. They were
giggling and holding each other in a very particular way. One woman even went
in there with two men.

Tiago started a slow song and the man who had invited me, put his arms around
me. I looked over at Travis and he nodded slightly. We moved to the music for a
moment or two before I walked away. I just couldn't get into it, not after what
I had noticed. I sat down next to Travis and said "What is this place? I am
sure I saw a woman kiss two different guys and I'm almost sure none of them
were the man she came in with."

"This is the place where you can let go. Nobody here will judge you. Just do
whatever it is you want to do, it's all okay here."

"But I saw people go through those rubber things, what's to do there?"

"When you're ready, you will see," he answer mysteriously, "Just have this wine
and let go. I give you permission to do whatever you want to do. Whatever
happens, happens and will stay here. I promise."

I looked at him, took a big gulp of my wine and watched a woman get on top of
one of those platforms and dance real sexy to the beat of the song. Very slowly
she unzipped her dress and when it fell on the floor she revealed a very nice
set of lingerie. The crowd cheered as she undid her bra and turned around
holding it up with her left arm, then on the beat she raised both her arms
revealing her breasts as the bra fell on the floor too. She was lifted up by
some guy and carried through those rubber sheets.

Suddenly I realized where we were, we were at a swingers club. People who
enabled their partners to be with other people and my heart started pounding.
With an open mouth I looked at Travis who just raised his shoulders and smiled.

I emptied my glass of wine and walked into the bar to get another one. I
couldn't believe where we were. I stood there at the bar when a man came
standing next to me. "First time?" he asked. I nodded and took another sip of
wine. "Yeah, my wife was just like you the first time. It's a lot to take in,
isn't it?" Again I nodded. "Yeah, she wasn't sure either when she first got
here. But she's over it now, she's somewhere around here having fun. Just
remember it's a gift your partner is giving you. It's the gift of freedom. He
loves you so much that he's willing to set you free. Because that's the only
way he knows he can keep you. It might sound strange but starting this
lifestyle made us closer than we have ever been."

I looked at him and said "Closer? But she's --"

"Yes, but I know I can never satisfy her. Not in the way these men can. She has
sex with them, but I'm the one she makes love with. There is a difference. This
is just lust, satisfaction, but it isn't love. That's what we share and that's
what she returns to every single time. Giving her this space made her love me
even more. But you have to be sure and ready. This lifestyle can so easily ruin
everything."

"But you, you aren't --"

"Oh, don't worry I get my share. It's different for us men, women can go for
hours and hours, have multiple orgasms, we men can't. Once we're spent we need
to wait for a while and then it's not even certain we can *perform*. So this is
what satisfies her needs and who am I to deny the one that I love what she
needs. If I do that I am hurting her and I love her too much for that."

"That somehow makes sense. Thank you." I saw Travis on the other end of the bar
watching us. Suddenly I felt an urge, something I never expected to happen. I
looked at this man and said "I'm Laura, by the way."

"Hi Laura, I'm Stephen." He was a very handsome black man and I had always had
this fantasy of being with a black man. We talked for a while longer and he
made me laugh. We looked at each other and then it just happened he put his
arms around me and we kissed. Gently at first but more passionate after. From
the corner of my eyes I could see Travis having the biggest smile on his face.

We made out furiously, I could feel his hands all over my body. He pulled my
dress aside and cupped my naked breasts. I couldn't help but moan. He took my
hand and guided me along the dance floor, my breasts still out in the open. My
heart was racing as we went through the rubber flaps. We walked into a large
room with a large rubber floor, clearly soft enough to lay on as there were a
few couples there. We both took off our shoes and laid down on a spot to the
side. We started kissing again, his hand went down on me and I spread my legs a
little. I groaned when he touched my clit and I felt myself getting wet. He
took off my dress and I took off his shirt. When we started to kiss again I
pressed my body against his muscular black torso. Suddenly I noticed someone
close to us, it was Travis he laid down next to us and was watching.

My hand wend down and I almost gasped when I felt how big he was. I undid his
buckle, unzipped his pants and took both his pants and his boxers off. I really
gasped when I saw what he had been hiding. I looked over at Travis he nodded
once more before I took it in my hand. This was the biggest penis I had ever
seen in my life. I slowly went down and looked Travis in they eyes as I slowly
stuck out my tongue to lick it. Travis had taken his dick out and was jerking
it. 

I closed my eyes and closed my mouth around this giant pole. It tasted so good
and I took it in deeper. I swirled my tong around this delicious cock and
Stephen place his hands on my head, pushing it down as far as it would go. I
felt him going down my throat and I started gagging. When I forced my head up
he released me and I had to take a deep breath. I started giggling and went
down again. Stephen pushed me down again and this time I could feel his balls
touch my chin. I had taken it all in, all 7 inches. When I was up again I felt
so proud of myself while I coughed to get some air.

Stephen pushed me on my back and kissed my nipples, he softly bit them and
sucked them. I reached out to Travis and he took my hand. I turned my hand and
looked into his eyes as Stephen was slowly working his way down. He took of my
thong and I spread my legs for him. The moment his tongue touched my clit I
moaned and squeezed Travis' hand. Stephen pushed his tongue inside my labia and
Travis kissed me. Then Stephen got on top of me and I knew what was about to
happen.

Travis leaned back holding my hands, he smiled at me as I looked at him. I
could feel the crown against my labia, spreading the lips slightly apart. With
one push Stephen was inside me and I moaned loudly. Travis leaned over and said
"Have fun!"

I put my arms around this big black man on top of me. Deeper and deeper he
went, I had never felt someone that deep inside me. I came almost instantly and
dug my nails in his shoulders. "Oh yes," I panted, "Fuck me. Fuck me hard."
Stephen started pumping and I felt every inch of him slide in and out of me. I
thought I went crazy. He kept on pumping and I had another orgasm. "Oh my God,
this feels so good. Yes, fuck me." I shouted. I had forgotten about the others
around us, all that was was this man and me. I spread my legs wide, as wide as
I possibly could. I wanted him to go deeper.

I looked at Travis and smiled when I saw he was being pleasured by some woman.
Stephen saw it too and said "I see that my wife it with your husband. Does that
turn you on?" All I could do was nod as I watched her getting on top of my
husband guiding him inside her. "I want to be on top too," I panted, "please,
let me get on top."

Stephen laid close to Travis and I got on top of him, as I slowly went down on
him I panted "Hi, I'm Laura." The woman looked at me with her gorgeous blue
eyes and long blonde hair. "April, don't you love my husbands cock?" I nodded
and started riding him. Seeing my husband being fucked by the wife of the man
inside me, really turned me on. I leaned over to April and we kissed, she
touched my boobs with her hands and softly squeezed them.

I had multiple orgasms on that big black cock inside me. At some point he
turned me on my back and just as he was about to push it inside me, I stopped
him. Looked at my husband to make sure he could see. I pulled off the condom
and laid it on my belly, then I looked Travis in the eyes and guided the
unprotected cock inside me. I turned to Stephen and whispered "Come inside me,
I want you to fill my pussy."

Hearing me say that was enough for Travis to explode, with a load groan he came
hard. Covering most of Aprils body. "Oh wow, that's a lot", April laughed. Then
she looked at her husband and said "You heard the slut, fill that pussy. I know
you want to. Give her all your cum, my darling. Give it to her. This little
whore, this slut, she wants you to."

The more April said those words the harder he started to pound me. From that
moment on I knew what women meant when they said being with a black man was
like being soul fucked. Without the condom I could really feel him and my
vaginal muscles contracted hard, I could feel him throb when he was about to
come. "Oh yes, give it to me. Fill my pussy with that seed. Impregnate me! Oh
yes, yes, yes, I'm coming again. Oh YEEEEESSS!!!" At the same time I had a huge
orgasm, one I had never felt before Stephen exploded too. I could feel wad
after wad of cum enter my vagina. "Oh yes, that's what I wanted. That's what I
needed!" I shouted, "Oh yes, fill that pussy!"

Travis kissed me as I felt Stephen unload inside me. I felt more love from him
than I had ever felt before. Stephen was right, by giving me this space I felt
more connected to my husband than had done mere minutes ago. Stephen sagged
down on me as we both tried to catch our breath. I could feel him getting
flaccid inside me and I loved it.

When he finally rolled off me, April leaned over and kissed me. "Let's clean
up," she said. She handed me my dress and my thong and guided me to a door to
the side. We stepped into a large shower with lots of shower heads but no
dividers. She turned on one of them and we waited for the water to get warm.
She walked over to a machine on the wall, turned a knob and got out two
sponges. She grabbed one of the many bottles of shower gel and walked up to me.
She looked me in the eyes as she started to wash me. The warm water felt so
nice on my now very sensitive skin.

Slowly she went down on me and suddenly she touched my clit with her tongue, I
leaned against the wall trying to get hold of something. She spread my labia
with her tongue and started to suck her husbands cum out of me. Within seconds
I orgasmed again. When she was done she rose and kissed me. She tasted so sweet
mixed with the taste of mine and her husbands fluids. We pressed our bodies
together as we made out. Her tongue deep inside my mouth. My hand went in
between her legs and I pushed two fingers inside her. She moaned loudly and I
fingered her until she too had an orgasm.

We finished cleaning ourselves, put on our dresses again and left the showers
hand in hand. Our husbands were waiting on us in the bar area where two wines
were waiting for us. I kissed Stephen again and thanked him for talking to me
and for the whole experience. "I had a lot of fun," I said as I handed him my
thong. "To remember me by." I whispered in his ear. I could hear April giggle
when she saw what I gave him and immediately she took off hers and handed it to
Travis.

We sat down at a table and talked for a while. We learned that April and
Stephen had adopted this lifestyle years ago. "And we've never been closer,"
April said, "The most important thing is to be open and honest. Not to hide
anything. I always tell him where I am going or where I've been. He might not
know who I've been with, but that's not important. Sometimes I even call him as
they are fucking me. He always knows that when I come home he will be the last
one that day and we make love. The rest is just sex, this is the man I make
love to."

We talked for quite some time longer and all that time I had Stephens cock in
my hand and his fingers were inside my pussy. The night ended with me
straddling Stephen right there. I pressed my body against his, my tongue in his
mouth. Whispering "Come inside me" in his ear.

By the time we went home I bent over and took Travis cock out as we were
driving. I sucked him all the way home as Stephens cum was dripping out of me.
We had the best sex we ever had after. It was like Travis was a beast
unleashed, he just ravaged me. When we lay in each others arms, an hour later,
I said "You were right. I do think I'm a little sick. Can you call in for me?"

Travis chuckled and said "Always."

## Chapter Four
In the months after our first visit to *Rosa Mundo* we returned a few times and
although we did have a good time every time we went, just the time it took to
get there in combination that only one of us could drink made us go less and
less. Plus most of the time I was too tired to drive back so it usually was
Travis who didn't drink and I hated that fact.

Now I hear you say why not get a room in a hotel? Well, because there weren't
any nearby. Even when we stayed in a hotel we still had to get there by car.
What about a taxi or an Uber? Because of the inconvenience. First we had to
wait for far too long and then we had quite a view rejections because either
one of us was too drunk or they thought we were, which made us have to wait for
even longer. No the easiest way was to go there in our own car.

All in all it meant that we went less and less, until it had been weeks if not
months since the last time we went. I felt myself getting restless, I started
to feel like I was missing something. First I could fill that need with the
dildos I had brought home. It felt so exciting, especially when Travis caught
me playing with them. It spiced things up for a while, but wasn't the same.

Then one weekend he had to go on a business trip. He had to leave on a Friday
and would return no earlier than Monday. That we had to cancel date-night
frustrated me, but I could live with it as it was only the first time we had to
do so. What was worse for me was that I wouldn't see Travis for almost 3 days
in total. I hated that fact.

Sure we would talk on the phone of Facetime, it just wasn't the same. We talked
when he safely arrived at the hotel and he told me how he had met this nice
woman from another company that was going to the came conference. "If you had
the chance," I asked, "would you take it?"

Travis thought for a moment and said "Not if you don't want me to. I mean
you're at home alone, so why should I get some fun?"

"That's so nice of you to say," I said, "But I wouldn't blame you. I don't know
how I would react if I were in your situation. I mean you already are in a
hotel, and it's not that she's a colleague or something."

"You're right," he said, "So you wouldn't mind?"

"No, I would prefer you didn't, but if it comes to it and she wants it too. I
wouldn't hold it against you. And I am totally being selfish here."

He laughed and said "We'll see what happens. I will tell you if it does, okay?"

"You better be," I replied and send him a kiss. "Sleep well honey, I miss you.
Bye, bye..."

The next morning I woke up and saw Travis had sent me a message. It was a
picture of him and that woman at the bar of the hotel. It looked like they were
having fun. Underneath there was a second message "Hi, my name is Irma and I
just wanted to tell you how wonderful Travis is. Especially when I told him I'm
gay." She ended the message with a large smile emoji and I burst into laughter.

Underneath was another photo, this time of Travis with a sad face waving a
pride flag. I knew how much fun they must have had making the photos and
sending me the messages. This was typical Travis, he always saw the humor in
things. I send him a photo of me with a big smile on my face with the following
text "Tell Irma I love her.". It didn't take Travis long to send me another
photo of the both of them at breakfast. "Well, at least I had breakfast with
her." he wrote underneath it. I could see by the face of Irma that she had
burst into laughter too when Travis told her what he was doing.

That day I went to the office for a while just to check on how things were
going, Saturday was mostly arrivals of new shipments and storing everything
away. And all my employees were going home at noon. I wanted them to have time
with their families during the weekend. When they all were gone I did some last
checks and went home too.

After spending the rest of the day at home I wanted to go for a drive, being
home alone drove me a little crazy and I just wanted to do something fun. I
went to the beach, walked the promenade there and just enjoyed looking at
people. At a small shop I got myself a beautiful summer dress and some
flipflops, the ones I had were almost gone.

I spent a few hours at a nail salon and just pampered myself a little. When I
got back to my car I drove to another side of town where I treated myself on a
nice dinner in a small restaurant with a view at the nearby park. I spent some
time at a mall nearby to get some makeup and other toiletries we needed. When
Travis called I was still at the mall and showed him some clothes I had seen.

"How was your day darling?" I asked him.

"Not as much fun as yours," he replied, "It was okay, a bit boring at some
points. But meeting people who are working in the same field is fun. I might
have dinner with some of them later."

"Okay, let me know if something *special* happens," I replied with a smile.

It was already getting dark when I got back in my car, driving home would take
me at least another 45 minutes. I was sure I could find my way back and got
lost after just a few turns. I ended up in a more dangerous part of town, not
that I didn't feel safe, but that what I was told it was. I parked my car when
I saw a parking lot and kept my car running so I could set my GPS. As I slowly
drove out of that lot my eyes fell on a group of women walking up and down the
street. I found a nicer spot to park and shut off my car. In the dark I just
looked at them.

When a car stopped nearby and a woman walked up to it I knew what was happening
and I felt some excitement. I wondered how it would feel being one of them,
walking the street dressed like that and then getting into a car to do whatever
it was they did. I spent some time looking at them before I decided to go home.

It was almost midnight when I arrived and I had received a message from Travis.
A photo of him in bed with clearly a woman behind him. She had turned her back
to the camera and seemed to be sleeping. "That rascal," I thought and texted
him back "You cheeky bastard" with a smile emoji.

I went to bed but just couldn't sleep, I kept thinking about those women on
that street. I opened my phone and the GPS app. Union Street to home, was the
last route I had used. Union street, I had to remember that. Within minutes I
was out of bed and staring at myself in the mirror. Then I took a shower, did
my makeup, put on something sexy and easy, grabbed my heels, my heels and got
into my car.

About half an hour later I was parked closer to those women. I just looked at
them, my nerves tens and my heart beating fast. I changed my sneakers for my
heels, stepped out of the car and put the keys in my purse. As I did that I saw
the strip of condoms I had put in there a few days before. You never knew what
could happen, right?

I took a few steps and returned to my car, then thought better of it and slowly
made my way over to that same sidewalk those women were walking on. A few of
them gave me the stank eye, bot all of them said nothing. To them I was just
the new girl, more competition. My heart kept racing as I took my first few
steps up and down that stretch of sidewalk. I was scared and excited at the
same time. When the first car turned the corner my heart skipped a beat, what
would I do if they asked for me to come closer?

They didn't and I heard the woman say "Hey honey, want some company? -- Oh,
darling it's 50 for a blow job and 100 for everything. Sure honey, show me the
way." And she got into the car. It didn't take long for another car to drive
by, slowing down near me. I just waved and moved like I had seen the other
women do. He slowly drove on and stopped at some other girl.

This repeated itself another six times and I got more confident with every car
that passed us. Then suddenly a car stopped near me and wanted me to come
closer. I leaned over into the open window, my loose blouse gave him the
perfect view and I said "Hey darling, want some company?"

He stared down my blouse and said "How much will that cost me?"

"Oh, 75 for a blow job and if you want to for 300 I'm yours for an hour."

"300? You must be crazy!"

I smiled and said "Well, it's an hour."

"Nah, too much." and he started to move again. I giggled softly as this was
exactly what I wanted to happen. I stood under a street light when another car
stopped near me. The window opened and I leaned in again. "Hey darling, want
some company?"

"How much?"

"50 for a blow job and for 300 I'm yours for an hour."

He looked at me and down my blouse. Then he said the words that terrified me:
"Get in." My God, this wasn't supposed to happen! But I had no choice and I got
into the car. We ended up in one of those sleazy hotels that rented rooms by
the hour. He opened the door for me and I stepped inside. It was as bad as I
had imagined it would be. He handed me the money when I told him he had to pay
upfront and reluctantly he agreed to condoms.

I freshened up in what was supposed to be a bathroom and stepped out again.
"Where did you want me?" I asked him. He took me in his arms and wanted to kiss
me. I turned my head and said "No kissing!" He grunted and took off my dress,
then my bra and my thong. He then undressed him self and I went down on my
knees. "Suck my cock," he said in a stern voice, "You filthy whore, suck it."

I did what he said and took his cock in my mouth. It tasted better than I
thought and the fact I was doing it for money really excited me. I pushed my
head down on him and I gagged on his dick. I coughed when he released me and I
felt myself getting wet. He then lifted me up and said "How much do want to
forget about the condoms?"

I wanted him to use them and said "Another 300."

To my utter surprise he took his wallet out of his pants on the floor and
handed me another 300 dollars. I put that in my purse too and he lifted me on
the table I was standing it, he spread my legs and pushed his cock deep inside
me. "Oh my God," I thought, "I'm officially a hooker now. A prostitute, a
filthy whore." That thought really turned me on and I felt my nipples getting
really hard. "Oh yes," I panted, "Fuck me, fuck this whore."

Hearing me say it made me come all over that strangers dick inside me. He had
paid for it and I enjoyed it way more than I thought I would. He fucked me hard
and long. He showed me all the corners of that room. He even pressed me against
the window and if anyone had walked by they could have seen me getting fucked.
To my surprise I came multiple times and after almost 50 minutes of constant
fucking he came all over my face. I loved the feeling of seamen on my face.

When he was done I grabbed my underwear, my dress and my purse. I went into
that bathroom and cleaned my face, touched up my makeup and put my clothes back
on. Twenty minutes later I was back on Union Street, now officially a
prostitute. I took another 20 minutes or so for another car to stop near me.
This man agreed too and we ended up in a different hotel. He was an older man
and just wanted some gentle loving. He told me he was a business man, not
married and lonely. I undressed and crawled into that bed with him, I pressed
myself against his body and started playing with his cock a little.

"Daddy?" I said in small voice, "Do to me what you do to mommy." I felt him
getting hard. "Oh daddy, what is this? Are you enjoying that I do this to you
daddy? I took off the sheets and gasped "Oh daddy! Bad daddy! I'm your
daughter!" I went down and licked it. He moaned and I asked him "Do you like
this daddy?" He nodded. When I finally crawled on top of him I said "Do you
want me daddy? Tell me how much you want me, daddy?"

"Oh please," he moaned, "Fuck your daddy? I wanted this for so long, Samantha.
I'm dreaming about this every day." By the tone of his voice I knew he was
talking to his real daughter and somehow that turned me on. "Oh daddy!" I said
and slowly I sat down on him. This time I did use a condom. I started to ride
him and asked "Do you like it daddy? Am I doing it right?"

"Yes, yes, you are doing it right Samantha. Oh yes, I wanted this for so long."

I kept riding him and said "Oh daddy, I think I am going to come. Oh yes, it
feels so good having you inside me daddy, so good. I'm coming daddy, watch your
daughter come all over that cock of yours. Yes, yes, YEEEES!" I faked an orgasm
and at the same time I felt him fill up that condom. He groaned loudly as he
came. I rolled off of him and he took off the condom. He took me in his arms
and I pressed my torso against him. "That was nice daddy." I whispered.

Afterwards we showered together and I sucked him one last time. He came in my
mouth this time and when we were dressed he handed me another 100 dollars. "For
the experience" he said. When he dropped me off at Union Street he sped off as
fast as he could. I turned around and walked towards my car, got in and went
home.

I had left a normal woman and came back a filthy whore. When I got home I
looked in my purse and got out the 700 dollars I had made in just a few hours.
I stepped into the shower and washed every inch of my body. Then I put lotion
on my legs and body, put on a gown and went to bed.

The next morning I woke up with a smile and wanted to do something fun with the
money I had made. I booked an appointment at the spa and pampered myself all
fay with massages, facials and a mud bath. The whole nine yards, at the end of
the day I went home feeling relaxed and clean. On my way home I stopped at the
mall and got myself that dress I had seen and a new pair of heels. As an extra
bonus I got one of the one-size-fits-all tube dresses.

When Travis called we talked for a while and I didn't tell him anything about
last night. I was going to but not on the phone. We talked about the woman he
had slept with and how they were going to get dinner later. "I told her all
about you and our marriage. She really would like to talk to you. Are you okay
with that?" I nodded and said "That would be nice, yes."

He handed to phone to the woman sitting next to him "Hi, I'm Kim. Nice to meet
you."

"Hi, I'm Laura. Did you have fun with my husband?"

"Yes, he was wonderful. I wanted to thank you for teaching him that well. My
boyfriend could learn a thing or two."

"So he knows?"

"Oh God no, and he never will. He's the jealous type, that what's makes this so
exciting for me. I love cheating on him."

"Whoa, did you know about this Travis?"

Travis took the phone from her and said "No, and I don't think I condone this.
She told me she was single." "That's what I tell all men, but I do not lie to
women, to my sisters." Kim said in the background.

"Well, it's your choice Travis. You know how I think about cheating."

"I know," Travis said, "And it won't happen again. Kim, please leave. And if
you don't tell him I will. And trust me I will find out where you live."

"You bastard!" She shouted, "I will tell everybody that you raped me! I will
get you for this!"

"Hey Kim!" I shouted, "Before you do that, know this. I am a business woman,
which is hard in a male dominated world. My phone records every single call,
including Facetime. So if you do that I will release this video on the
internet. Or we will show it to police. So you do whatever it is you want to
do, girl, but know that I will destroy you. I will take everything you own."

She stopped walking and looked at the phone Travis had pointed at her. She
looked at him and back to the phone, she grunted and left the room. Travis
turned the camera on himself and I asked "Think she believed me?"

"Why not? I would." Travis replied with a chuckle.

"Well, we'll see what happens. I think she's been scared enough, don't you?"

"Another reason why I love you." he replied.

We hung up and I chuckled. On a side note, we never heard anything from Kim
again. We later learned she was caught fraternizing with her boss and was
fired. Her boyfriend left her when he heard she had been unfaithful and as far
as we know she moved away at some point.

It was after midnight and I looked at myself wearing that tube dress and my new
heels. I wore long earrings and had my hair in a pony tail. I threw on a
jacket, grabbed my purse and just under an hour later I was back on Union
Street. When the first car stopped near me he asked me to show the merchandise
and I pulled down the top of my dress showing him my breasts. He agreed to the
price and I had sex with him for an hour.

When I got into my car again I opened my purse and counted 1250 dollars for
just over 6 hours of work. That was more than I made working my ass off at my
own company. When I got home I took another shower, sponged myself with lots of
shower gel and went to bad feeling satisfied.

In total I had fucked nine men that weekend and couldn't wait for Travis to
come home. I made myself beautiful for him, wore a very sexy dress I had bought
especially for him that morning and sat down waiting for him to come home. He
had texted me when he had landed and in a taxi. The longer it took the more
nervous I got.

When I heard the keys in the door, I stood up and took a sexy pose. When he
stepped in he smiled when he saw me. On the table next to me he saw 1950
dollars spread out like a fan. He looked at it, then at me and asked "What is
going on?"

I walked towards him and told him in sexy voice "Why don't you undress me?" I
turned my back to him and he pulled the zipper down. I turned around and pushed
my finger on his torso. I pushed him all the way to the couch and said "Sit
down, enjoy!" I walked as sexy as I could to the stereo and started the music.
I danced for him, bent over and just as I was about to pull down my dress. I
turned my back to him, I bent over once more and showed him my covered pussy. I
pulled the dress over my hips and let it drop on the floor. I stood up, looked
at him over my shoulder and was happy to see him jerking his cock.

With one foot I stepped out of the dress, with the other I kicked it away. I
turned halfway around and showed him some side boob. I licked my lips covered
with the reddest lipstick I could find. Then I slowly pulled down my thong for
him and kicked it away too. I told him to close his eyes and he did. I pulled
down his pants and took off his shirt.

I straddled him and guided his cock inside my pussy. "Open your eyes," I
whispered in his ears. As he did I leaned backwards so he could read what I had
written on my belly: "You are fucking a real life prostitute!" Underneath I had
written "Whore Pussy" with an arrow towards my vagina.

"What?" he scampered.

I leaned forward again and whispered "I had sex with 8 men and gave one a
blow job. I got 50 for the latter and 200 an our from the rest. One was so
satisfied he tipped me 100 dollars. I had sex for money all weekend, it was so
sexy and I really got off on them. I loved it so much I want to do it again an
again."

He put his arms around me and I held his head in my arms, my mouth was close to
his and he kissed me. "Yes, kiss this whore." I panted, "I've sucked 10 men
this weekend. Three of them came in it." He started to breath heavily.

"How --"

"I got lost and I saw these girls. I was so horny and you were so far away. At
first I just wanted to stand there, feel what it was like. Then one of them
agreed to my price. He fucked me for over an hour, I thought I couldn't walk
after he was done. I came so hard on his cock, Travis, so hard. Can you feel
it? My pussy is so tight now. He offered me another 200 not to use a condom and
I agreed. Your wife had sex without a condom for 400 dollars and he fucked me
so good. He even pressed me against the window so everybody got to see how I
was getting fucked."

"Oh my god," Travis panted, "this is so hot."

"Then there was this older man. Lonely, he wanted to role play. So I played his
daughter. I sucked him asking him if I did a good job, that dirty daddy. I rode
him asking him constantly if it was okay. He called me Samantha and I think he
was talking about his *real* daughter. That man wants to fuck his daughter,
Travis, I know he does. That turned me on more than I thought."

"Oh yes, yes, tell me more."

"Last night I just went back there. Can you see me? High heels, my hair in a
pony tail, wearing a sexy dress? Do you see your wife on that street selling
her body? You do, don't you? Well, the first one who stopped wanted a blow job,
so we went somewhere safe and I sucked him until he came. Then I got into a car
and that man just wanted some company, we ended up having sex in his car. I had
my boobs out and if anybody had walked by they could have seen me ride him.
Then there was this guy who wanted to fuck outside, somewhere risky. We went
into the park until we found a good spot. I put a condom on him and he fucked
my as I bent over. Right there in plain sight at the park. It was so exciting."

"Tell me more, more."

"The last one was special. The others not so much. Shall I tell about the
special one?" Travis nodded. "Okay, I got into his car and we drove to this
fancy hotel. We started kissing after he handed me the money. We made out for a
long time before he undressed me. I went down on him and took his big cock in
my mouth. A big black cock. It was so big it hardly fitted in my mouth. I
licked it, sucked it and then he lifted up my leg and ever so slow he pushed it
inside me. It was so big, Travis, the biggest cock I have ever had. He
stretched me so wide and I loved it so much. He went in so deep, so deep, I can
still feel him."

"We fucked standing up for a while, then he took me to the balcony, leaned me
over balustrade. We were only on the second floor, anyone who looked up could
see my flapping breasts. He fucked me so hard there they were slapping against
my body, Travis. When he finally pulled out we went back inside. He pushed me
on the bed and just before he entered me again I took of the condom. I wanted
to really feel him, he fucked me for a while like that. Then he did something
special, very special. He took it out and pressed his cock against my ass.
Slowly he pushed on until it popped inside. It hurt so much, but I didn't want
him to stop. He pushed on deeper and deeper into my ass. Until he finally was
all the way in. I orgasmed so hard, Travis, so hard."

"Then he started sliding in and out. It started to feel good. Even better with
every thrust he made. I screamed, shouted to fuck me harder. Fuck my ass, fuck
me. I shouted. He fucked me so hard until he came and exploded deep inside my
ass. I loved it so much Travis, so much."

"Show me."

I lifted myself up and placed Travis' cock against my ass, I relaxed and he
pupped inside. I slowly pushed down and moaned. "Just like that", I panted,
"Your wife is a filthy whore and I love it. I sold my ass to a client and he
fucked me for 200 dollars. I love being a whore, a slut, a prostitute. Oh my
God, just saying those words out loud makes me come. Oh yes, yes, fuck this
whore. I am your whore, Travis, yours to do with what you want. Sell me to the
highest bidder and I will fuck them. I want to be your whore, I will do
whatever you want. Just pimp me out, sell my pussy. I want you to so bad."

Within seconds Travis exploded inside me and I pressed myself down hard on him.
"Oh yes, fill this filthy whore, this prostitute." and I had a big orgasm.

## Chapter Five
It had become somewhat of a routine, every evening during the weekend from
Friday to Sunday I would get ready to go to work. I took a long shower, did my
makeup, got dressed and around midnight I would leave after kissing my husband
goodnight.

I would return around 6 or 7 in the morning and he would ask "How was work?"
and I would reply with the amount of money that was in my purse, One weekend I
made just over 3000 dollars, which basically meant I had spent 15 hours in the
arms of another man. Every single morning I would tell him all I had done and
he would be the last *John* of the night.

This lasted for a couple of months and we made some good money that period. It
all ended when I went to work a little later than I usually did. I drove to
Union Street and when I arrived I saw police everywhere. I drove on at a normal
speed as my heart was racing. The next day we realized that if I had arrived
there just ten minutes earlier I would have been amongst the ones arrested.

I had dodged a bullet that night just because I wanted to be with Travis for
just a little longer. I can't really explain how I felt. On the one hand I felt
relieved, on the other sad. Relieved that I hadn't been arrested, sad because
now I had nowhere to go. The longer this impasse lasted the more restless I
became. I had gotten addicted to the thrill of being on that street, the rush
of having sex for money and it was such easy money too. I made more in a
weekend than I did working full time all week and I was the CEO of that
company.

So we started looking into alternatives, something that would give me a similar
thrill. Sure I went to other streets in the mean time but it just wasn't the
same, the hookers were dirtier, cheaper, the Johns were even worse. Being on
those streets was scary, nothing like Union Street that felt somewhat safe or
at least safer.

We looked into escorting, call-girls and other forms of prostitution. We also
checked into the chance of getting arrested for it. But it was the amount of
girls that got severely beaten and even died that made us look for something
else.

We learned about The Netherlands and were amazed by the fact that sex-work was
legal over there. You had to pay taxes, start a company and adhere to regular
checks to see if everything was safe and clean. It was simply unbelievable, so
we checked more sources until we came across the official website of the Dutch
Government and all our findings were confirmed.

Then we learned about the national healthcare system, living without the fear
of getting shot and the more we learned the more we wanted to go. We watched
videos on YouTube and we fell in love with what we saw. We finally got all the
information we needed to emigrate to the land of our dreams. "Oh I can't wait
to ride a bike to the store," I said one day, "Can you imagine? It must be so
wonderful."

"But what if it rains?"

"Well, as that one girl said. We've got raincoats." I chuckled.

It was a humongous blow for our parents when we told them we were going to live
in The Netherlands. When my father asked why I said "Everything. Every time I
go outside I am afraid to get shot. If we go to a restaurant we check where we
can hide in case of a shooter. That's no way to life. Then there is healthcare,
you have a national healthcare over there. You know for how much? Around 200
euros a month, that's about 340 dollars. You know what I pay now for my
healthcare? 600 dollars! And that's just mine. And it doesn't even cover
everything."

Travis continued by saying "We're just tired of looking over our shoulders all
the time. We didn't realize it until we started looking at other countries.
When we learned that over in Europe they work to live and not the other way
around, I was sold. I have a decent job. How many vacation days have I got?
Zero. If I take time off I'm not getting paid and they look at me if I'm some
sort of traitor. Over there you have 20 weekdays, that's about a month. And if
you do not spend them, they just send you home and tell you to come back in
four weeks."

My father said "But they are all communist over there, I heard --"

"Then you heard wrong, dad. It's a social-democratic state. They have all of
our freedoms and they still take care of those who need it. You can still say
the government sucks, or our premier is a bastard. That's all protected. And
you know what they don't have?"

"I don't know," my father replied.

"Mass shootings every single week, not one in over 400 years."

"I just don't want you to go, sweetie."

"I know dad," I replied, "but once we're settled we will get you a ticket to
come over. It's not that expansive, just over 300 dollars, round trip. You
spend more than that flying to Seattle."

"Wow, I'm still not happy. But you're and adult now and married. So I couldn't
stop you if I wanted to. Please be safe over there. I heard about places where
the police not even want to go."

"All lies dad," I replied with a soft voice, "They simply don't exist. It's
been debunked over and over again. Look, I've got it on my phone. This is an
official statement of the Dutch government, this is the prime-minister of the
Netherlands. Hear what he has to say." I played the short video and just looked
at him. "This is official dad and this was the fourth time he had to make that
statement."

"Still --"

"Come on dad," I replied, "Why would he lie? What does he have to win?"

With that the discussion was over and we started the process of moving to The
Netherlands. We went through all the hoops, dotted every i, crossed all the
t's. We had found a nice area where we wanted to live and had set our eyes on
an old farm. We had outbid them all and the sale was made final. "We can sign
all the paper when you arrive," the agent said. We had sent them half the money
upfront as a sort of bond.

When the emigration was approved by the Dutch Embassy we started selling
everything. I sold my company to a competitor and made a nice profit with which
we were able to buy the farm and leave just a small mortgage, something the
agent advised us to do. The mortgage was approved by the bank in record time
when we showed them the deed of our apartment and what it was worth. The prices
had gone up in the time we lived there and Travis got a nice bonus on his last
day of work.

In the end our apartment was empty, all we owned was in a couple of suitcases.
We had all our papers and the green cards where waiting for us at the Dutch
Embassy in Amsterdam. When I asked how we could get there the girl on the phone
laughed. "Just go to our office on Schiphol Airport. Everything will be ready
for you there."

"Thank you," I replied, "I didn't know. This is our first time dealing with
embassies. I am so sorry."

"That's quite alright, madam. Have a pleasant flight and just one more thing.
They day you arrive it will be quite warm. So do not wear heavy clothing."

"Thank you, we will keep that in mind. Thank you so much. Bye."

My parents arrived first, closely followed my Travis'. We put all we wanted to
bring in the cars and they dropped us off at the airport. We had to make just
one more stop, handing our keys to the Realtor. With that it was all gone,
everything we ever owned had been sold, given to charity or packed into our
suitcases. We had to pay a lot for the extra weight but the nice lady from KLM
said that it was normal in cases of emigration.

We said good bey to our parents after all the luggage was checked in, weighed
and confirmed. We were just one pound under the weight we had asked for. Saying
good bye was hard, harder than I expected. But we were excited too. The flight
lasted for just over 7 hours and was rather boring. I watched a couple of
movies, tried to sleep a little until we finally heard:

"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We will arrive at our
destination a little earlier than expected. We hope you had a nice flight and
if you are able to look out the window you can see the lights of Rotterdam, the
third largest port in the world. The weather will be a comfortable 21 degrees
Celsius and for our Imperial friends that's about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. It
will be a sunny day, so I do hope you have your sunglasses ready. I will turn
on the sign to fasten your seat belts within the next 5 minutes. This will give
plenty of time to fold in the tables and put your chairs in an upright
position. Expected time of arrival will me around 8:30 in the morning, local
time. Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for flying Royal KLM and please fasten
your seat belts."

I was just about ready packing everything when the sign turned on. The cabin
personnel helped me with my seat belt and we landed safely about 10 minutes
later. About half an hour later we had all our luggage which was a cart full of
suitcases. After asking directions we got to the embassy rather quickly.

"Hello, how can I help you?" the girl said.

"Yes, we're the Davis family. We were told our green cards would be ready?"

"Oh yes, let me check. Okay, here they are. I just need your passports,
please." She stamped them and handed them back to us together with our green
cards. "Just to make sure. You are required to check in every month with the
embassy until your official paper are approved. These cars enables the both of
you to work here in The Netherlands. Until you get your permanent status you
are required to pay taxes in both The Netherlands and the USA. I am sorry, but
it's just like that. Now let me be the first to welcome you officially to The
Netherlands."

"Thank you so much, thank you. Where do we go now?"

"Just go through customs and show them these papers. They will know then that
this is more than just a holiday. They might still have a few questions, but we
have granted you access so it's just a formality."

"Thank you again."

Going through customs with all that luggage was scary. But I didn't have any
reason to be scared. The man checked our passports, our green cards and the
other documents we had received from the embassy. "Ah, new citizens," he said,
"Welcome to our little country. It's mandatory for us to check your luggage for
anything that isn't allowed to import into the EU. But I see in here that you
checked the option that you checked it beforehand. So we will just check one or
two suitcases, okay?"

We nodded and waited for them to finish. They closed our cases better than we
had done them in the US. The man turned to us, handed everything back to us and
said "Welcome to The Netherlands, Mr and Mrs Davis. You are free to go enjoy
our little piece of heaven."

I couldn't help but chuckle, these customs officers were way more relaxed the
their American counterparts. They had checked everything, which was the main
reason we went over the list of contraband more than twice. Outside the gate at
arrivals we saw someone standing holding up a sign with our names. "Welcome to
the Netherlands," he said, "I'm Peter, my mother is the Realtor? She told me to
pick you up. My van is just outside and I will bring you there. It's about a
two hour drive and we thought it might be better if one of us were here to pick
you up."

"Thank you so much," I almost cried, "I expected a lot but nothing like this.
Thank you oh so much. Do you know where we can exchange our money?"

"Sure, just over there."

"Stupid of me. I didn't even see those signs. I'm just so tired. Do we still
have time, I don't want to inconvenience you."

"Oh no, go ahead. Your husband and I can pack the van. That will take a minute
or two."

When I arrived at the van I handed Peter 100 euro's "Here you are. Please take
it, I will feel guilty if I didn't pay for gas. It's the least I can do and
it's still cheaper for us than renting a car."

"Not necessary, but appreciated." Peter said with a smile, "You can sleep if
you want to go in the back." he said as we got in the car. Travis looked at me
and said "Go, get some sleep. I'm too excited any way."

I woke up almost an hour later. "Ah, she's awake," Travis said, "our sleeping
beauty. Welcome back to earth, darling. We're near Zwolle, it's so beautiful
here and the roads are just amazing."

"How long and can we stop somewhere. I need to go to the ladies room."

"Oh, okay. Just over three kilometers ahead. There's a restaurant. We could
stop there for a coffee or something. Stretch our legs a little."

"Three kilometers, what's that in miles?" I asked.

"About five miles sweetie," Travis said. I looked in his hand and shouted "You
cheat! You are using your phone, aren't you?" Travis laughed and said "Yes, I
was just so curious when I read the signs. We'll get used to it. It's quite
easy actually, Peter explained it to me. Correct me if I'm wrong now but 1
kilometer is 1000 meters. I meter is 100 centimeters. And one centimeter is 10
millimeters. It all goes down by a factor of ten. No more strange factions,
like 3/8th of an inch. It just 25 centimeters, or 0.25 meters. It's way
easier, if you get your head around it."

"That might take a while, never been good at math."

We stopped at that restaurant and I went to the bathroom. I looked at Peter and
winked at Travis, who got a huge smile on his face. When Peter went to the
bathroom I ran after him and pulled him into the ladies. I pushed him in a
booth and pulled down his pants. Within seconds I was sucking his cock and
right after I pulled down my pants, kicked off my left shoe and pulled out my
leg and lifted it up. I took his cock and guided him inside me. We fucked
quietly and held our breath when someone entered after us.

He fucked me nice and quick, came all over my face and we got dressed once
again. I told him to be quiet and we sneaked out of there. With his cum still
on my face, we walked out that restaurant and back to the van. Once in there I
got in front so Travis could sleep. I cleaned my face and when I was bored I
leaned over and sucked Peter some more. He came again, this time filling my
mouth and I swallowed it all. When I came up I smiled at him and said "Sorry, I
felt an itch that needed scratching. He blushed and said "That's alright."

"Are you done sucking him?" Travis said from the back, "Some people are trying
to sleep over here." We all burst into laughter and the rest of the trip went
smoothly. We stopped at the Realtor to get our keys and Peter dropped us off at
hour new home. Travis carried me over the threshold and we started to look
around. All we had seen were photos and in reality it was even better.

In the bedroom I pushed Peter against the wall and we made out. Within minutes
I was naked and leaning against the window. He was fucking me from behind and I
moaned loudly. When he was done I kissed him and told him "You were my first
dutch guy. I will always remember this. Thank you." After that day Peter came
by regularly, as he became an household friend as well as a fuck-buddy.

For us the period of renovations had started and it would take us over a year
to complete. Travis had gotten a job in the town nearby and I orchestrated the
renovations. Sometimes treating the men something special. Our house was the
first to be ready and we finally could get some new furniture. Until that
moment we had lived on borrowed items or furniture from a thrift store. I had
fallen in love with one of the wardrobes and didn't want to part with it
anymore. It would be the only piece that would remind us of this period in our
lives.

By the time our outside buildings were finished we had gotten our permanent
status and celebrated no longer needing to go to the embassy anymore. When all
was done Travis started to work from home for the new company he was working
for now. He had found his dream job which enabled him to work from home or the
office we had built.

I officially registered as a sex worker and learned about the necessary paper
work that came with it. Launching my own escort website was worth another
celebration. At first I worked alone, months later I had six girls working for
me. All they had to do was pay me a monthly fee for administration costs and
handling their appointments.

Right after that our parents came over for a visit they would stay a week and I
handed the business over to Dream, I trusted her the most and she had been
working for me the longest.

Our parents were amazed by where and how we lived. My father completely change
his mind about Europe and the Netherlands especially. He loved it here. "And
imagine those kids," I said when we walked through the nearby town, "They can
not only safely play outside. They never had an active shooter drill, simply
because it doesn't happen over here."

"They look so happy," my mother said.

"The happiest children in the world," I replied, "You've seen them now. They do
exist."

We had made some Dutch friends and one very close couple. They were the first
we told about my job. They were amazed but not shocked. "It's the oldest
profession in the world, they say," Robert said and with that it all was okay.
Not long after that I was having sex with him and his wife was being fucked by
Travis. She started working for me not long after.

We had built a good life for ourselves and were happy. Moving to The
Netherlands was one off the best things we ever did.
