## Chapter One
Days before that night I was already anxious, it could mean a giant change in
my life, one that there was no going back from. Once it was going to happen
there was no way of taking it back. Yes we had talked about it and yes he was
in total support of it, yet I wasn't really sure whether I wanted to go through
with it. The closer we got to that day the more I thought about it, it just
never left my mind.

On the one hand I really wanted to do it, I had been dreaming about it, it had
been a fantasy for such a long time. On the other hand it would mean I broke
the vows I took when I said "I do". Those vows also meant a lot to me, I was
raised with the idea that marriage was the highest commitment possible, one
that shouldn't be broken. Not that we were extremely religious, but Catholic
values ran deep in our family. And I had always been a good Catholic girl.

"Looking forward to Friday", my husband said.

I just nodded and whispered "Yes."

"What's the matter?"

"I'm just not sure. I thought I was, but I'm getting seconds thoughts. Maybe we
should agree on a code word so I can tell you that I want to go home."

"Sure, look I don't want you to be uncomfortable with this. It's all your call,
no matter what you decide I will support you."

Hearing him say that comforted me a lot, I slightly smiled and whispered "Thank
you."

We agreed on the word *Magnolias*, they were my mothers favorite flowers.
