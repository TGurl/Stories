# Growing Up

## Chapter One
"Just turn your head and look over your left shoulder," the photographer said.
It was my very first photo shoot and I couldn't really believe that I was
actually doing this. My parents weren't really happy with it when I told them,
but I just couldn't just do this without telling them. My mother especially
wasn't pleases. "How can you? We didn't raise you this way," she said with
tears in her eyes. I felt sorry for her. "Mom, they are glamour photos, nothing
sexy or explicit. People kept telling me to think about modeling and this pays
the bills."

"That might be true," she said, "but having them published in a national
magazine for all people to see?" I hugged her and said "I know mom, I know. But
it's not that big of a deal anymore. Times have changed. And I didn't want to
do this without telling you." She just nodded and calmed down a little.

"Beautiful," the photographer said, "Just look into the camera now. Yes, like
that." After just another few photos I was finished for the day. I put on my
robes and walked towards the makeup area where they removed my makeup and I got
dressed into my regular clothes.
