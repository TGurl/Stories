# Being Shared
*an erotic tale by Transgirl*

## Chapter One
All I can say is that I wasn't born this way and absolutely not raised this
way, the changes were hardly noticeable and they all added up until I was where
I am today. Not that I'm complaining, it's who I am today and I am perfectly
fine with it. To enable our lifestyle and not be in constant fear of being
molested we even moved to another country, which brought us more than just the
ability to be who we truly are.

We now live just outside a small town in the middle of The Netherlands where
we were able to buy an old farm including the surrounding land. The property is
totally surrounded by woods and we got permission to put up a 7ft fence just as
long as it blended in with the environment. It took us a while to find someone
who could create one that looked as natural as possible and we ultimately got
permission from the council to put it up. Now when you walk through the woods
you don't even see a fence until you're right on top of it, giving us total
privacy.

We totally renovated the old farmhouse and barns into the property of our
dreams. As it is located on a very small street leading to practically nowhere
it is also very quiet most of the time. Only traffic that really needs to be
there or sometimes people who are just cruising use that road. And our house is
almost 82 feet from that road, so even in front of the property we have some
sort of privacy. We didn't get permission to put up a fence there, but that's
okay as it now is a very beautiful garden and my pride and joy. I never would
have thought gardening would give me so much satisfaction.

There were a few more barns on the property, which mostly were torn down or
renovated to guest quarters and an office for us. It's nice not to have to
work in the house itself, to have a detached building for that purpose. It
makes us feel like we still are going to work instead of just moving to another
room. "I'm off to work," is now one of our most favorite things to do. For fun
we even listen to the traffic report and if it's bad we jokingly say "Better
get going then."

One day my husband just stood in the middle of our property. When I was about
to ask him why he called me saying "Oh man, traffic is a mess. I think I going
to be late. Oh wait, we started moving again. I love you. Bye." I burst into
laughter and shook my head. He turned his head to me, stuck his tongue out and
disappeared into the office.

I do have to say moving to The Netherlands was one of the best decisions we
ever made. Not only is it very beautiful here, it's also safe and well
organized. Doing what I am doing it's so nice to know that our medical bills
are covered and we will never see bills we can't pay. Medical debt isn't a
thing here. And don't get me started about guns. I never knew what freedom
truly meant until we moved here. In the US I was always on the lookout where I
could hide in case of a shooter, that's not necessary here because it simply
doesn't happen.

We experienced some sort of PTSD the first few months we lived here and some
say we still do. And maybe they're right, I sometimes catch myself flinching
whenever there is a loud bang. I like to believe it's gotten a lot better
though.

We've been living here for over six years now and we've decided to never go
back. Sure it's not easy leaving friends and family behind, but the truth of
the matter is that when they came over for a visit they too experienced the
same things we did. It made us chuckle when we sat outside a small cafe in the
center of town our friends ducked when a car misfired. "Americans?" the people
at the next table asked. We just nodded and said "Yes. We are too, but we live
here now."

But all of that is about how it is now. Before I tell more about that I have
to tell you how it all began. That's important for you to understand 

a. Why we do what we do.
b. Why we moved to another country.

I simply can't explain it any other way and trust me I tried. This isn't the
first draft of this story, I've tried many other ways to get it onto paper, or
my computer that is. Could I have done a better job? I am sure I could have,
but I'm not a professional writer and this is my best attempt on writing it all
down. I've read quite a few stories from couples enjoying this lifestyle and I
wanted to share ours.

To protect the identities of everyone involved, including ours, I have changed
names and locations where it all took place. In some cases I've used names that
don't even exist, the college we went to for example. But I promise the rest of
it is all true, the events that took place did happen as I will write them
down.

So let's start at the beginning.

## Chapter Two
I was so nervous the day I got to hear whether I had graduated or not. I waited
for hours for the phone to ring and when it finally did my heart skipped a
beat. "Laura?" the voice of my favorite teacher said on the other side of he
line, "I've got good news --" That's all I needed to hear, I started screaming,
yelling, jumping and when I calmed down and went back to the phone I could hear
her laughing. "Laura? Are you there?"

"Yes Miss Johnson, I am here."

"Good. Yes, you passed. But did you really think there was a chance you
didn't?"

"Always Miss, always. Thank you so much for calling."

"No worries, have a nice day now and see you at graduation." she said.

I threw down the phone and jumped into my mothers arms. "I passed!" I shouted,
"I passed!" We both were happy and called my father as soon as we both calmed
down. I took a deep breath, dialed the number and waited for him to pick up.

"Did they call?" he somehow knew it was us.

"Yes, they did." I said with a trembling voice. My mother looked at me with a
face saying 'what are you doing?'.

"Oh baby, and what did they say?"

"Well, Miss Johnson called." I kept up the tremble as if I was about to start
crying, "And she was very nice and all. But -- I PASSED! Dad, I am graduating!
I'm going to college!"

"I knew it!" he said, "I just knew it! Oh sweetie, I'm coming home early this
afternoon, we are going to celebrate." During dinner that evening he couldn't
stop telling everybody that I passed, he was so proud of me. Now, it's
important for you to understand that we weren't rich people, nor were we poor.
My dad had to work hard to get where he was and me going to college was the
crown on his achievement. I was an only child as my mother wasn't able to have
children after me. The fact that I even existed was kind of a miracle for them.

That should explain why the were so protective of me, not overbearing but still
protective. I was raised to be a good girl on old fashioned values, but still
strong and independent too. On top of that we lived in a very small town where
almost everybody knew each other. Therefor being different was frowned upon and
as I didn't know any different I fell into that mold too.

Going to college was eye opening in that aspect. Suddenly I was confronted with
people who had different thoughts and ideals. At first I was defensive as I
wanted to preserve the old-fashioned way of life. What was so wrong with
getting married and start a family? It wasn't like I condemned sex before
marriage, I just chose otherwise.

That all changed when my room mate decided to change colleges, she wanted to
live closer to home and not, like me, be on the other side of the country.
After being alone for a few months I got assigned a new room mate as mine was
the only room available for her. At first we didn't get along that well, she
was the total opposite of me. Where I was an introvert, and still am, she was
an extrovert. And she had her tongue on her sleeve, she just said how she felt
whether you liked it or not.

Slowly I started to respect her for that, she simply didn't care what anyone
thought. "Why should I?", she once told me, "If I had to take what everyone
thinks about me, I wouldn't get anything done. There's always someone who is
offended or disagrees with whatever it is you do, wear or say. As long as you
think it's right for you, why should you care about what anybody thinks. It's
your life, not theirs."

"But aren't you scared you are offending someone?" I asked her.

"As long as I don't care about them, no. I care what the people close to me
think and those are the ones I listen to. Not some random person on the street
or the internet. God, that would make life so hard."

Those words made me rethink some thing I had been taught and I had to conclude
she was right. In a small town it is doable to adhere to unwritten rules, in a
city the size of where my college was not so much. There were millions of
people living there and there were just as many opinions. How could I take all
of those into account? I simply couldn't. So why should I change anything I
wanted to do or wear? If I wanted to wear a dress with pentagrams all over it,
why couldn't I? I wasn't religious and if you didn't like it you could always
look the other way.

Over the years I was in college the way I dressed changed, from rather
conservative and modest to outspoken and the latest fashion. I toned it down
whenever I went back home, but still it was quite different from what people
were used to. My mother loved it though, she thought I looked beautiful.

In the third year of college more had changed, my thoughts on marriage. It no
longer was the ultimate goal for me. Not that I didn't want to get married
anymore, it just wasn't a goal anymore. Being single, moving in together or
getting married, it all was fine with me. That also meant my ideas about sex
had changed. I can still remember how I felt after the first one-night-stand, I
was elated and felt freed. Released from the shackles I had put on myself.

I went through a period where I had multiple *encounters* a week. Even Marisha,
my room mate, thought I went off the reservation during that time. I just
couldn't get enough of it. A night I had some sort of regret after was when I
went home with a couple of boys and spent the night as their toy. That was the
moment I knew I had gone too far and I needed to reel it back in. Luckily those
weren't college boys and the only one who knew was Marisha.

During my last year I met Travis, now my husband. We started dating and because
he had gone through some relationships before me, he wanted to take it slow.
That might be the main reason why when he proposed I said yes. We had taken our
time to get to know each other, to trust each other and more importantly to be
totally honest with each other. He didn't judge me when I told him about my
*promiscuous* period. "That's a phase you had to go through", he said when I
had told him, "I do believe you when you tell me that's over now."

After we got married we moved into a small apartment downtown. With only one
bedroom and an open kitchen it was our little kingdom, our slice of heaven. He
got a nice job and I worked mostly from home for a company that published
books for children. As an English major that was the only job I could land,
besides teaching. Editing books wasn't my favorite thing to do, but it was a
job and someone had to do it.

At first working from home was ideal for me, not having to spend hours in a day
stuck in traffic was my idea of the ideal job. But as soon as the runt set it,
it became rather isolating. I only knew my colleagues from the screen and I
started to miss the physical interaction of being in an office. Besides that
the work I was doing wasn't why I had gone to college and get a business
degree. I had always dreamed of either working for a large company as some sort
of manager or to start my own little company.

It didn't take me long, maybe three years, to conclude this wasn't it for me
and after talking to Travis I decided to quit. I simply had enough. By that
time Travis had been promoted twice and we moved into a more luxury apartment
just outside of the city center. I was a housewife for a while until that
started to bore me too. The apartment wasn't that big and cleaning it didn't
take all day. Nor did the laundry and anything else you do. To make a long
story short I started to follow my dream of having my own business.

As it was the easiest way I started selling clothes online, mostly women's
clothing. I bought up stock from failing businesses and sold them for a small
profit online. There were many times our apartment was filled with boxes and
boxes of goods. I was packing and sending those out for days on end, until I
was finally convinced of renting a space somewhere. It so happened that one day
I got hold off clothing meant for the *adult* market. I simply couldn't believe
how quick those went out the door again.

I started buying and selling more of those until I finally stopped selling
*regular* clothes all together. I sold everything, from lingerie to latex
suits, even some BDSM related things like masks, gags and collars. Then I
started selling toys too.

As I couldn't do this through the site I had been using I hired a company to
design and host my new website. I also changed the name of the company to
*Sexy4Less*. And it skyrocketed from there. I had to move offices as we needed
more space for our stock and more space to package it all, I even had to buy
two vans so we could ship everything. Suddenly I was the CEO of a small
company and instead of selling second hand I made deals with companies
overseas. All in all the main goal was to be cheaper than anyone else, a goal
we succeeded in most of the time.

Setting up the company took most of my time and as Travis was working long
hours too we started to drift apart. To counter this we implemented date-night,
every Friday we went to dinner and after to a movie or a bar. As Travis never
had been the dancing type I would dance with random men who were there. At
first I kept my distance, but at some point I allowed them to put their arms
around me for a slow dance. At no point Travis showed signs of jealousy, he
seemed to enjoy it rather.

One evening when we drove home he bluntly asked me "Did you want to kiss him?"

I felt a little offended by that question and responded "Why would you even ask
that?"

"Just by the way you looked at him. Did you find him attractive?"

"What?! No, I didn't find him attractive. He was a good dancer and it was a
beautiful song, that's all."

"If you say so." he replied and the discussion was over. But it started me
thinking whether Travis had been right. I started to question myself because if
I was honest with myself I had felt attracted to that man. I just hadn't
realized until Travis brought it up. At that moment I was never going to admit
that to him as it was just wrong. It wasn't they way I was raised and it went
against everything I thought was right.

For the rest of the week my business took my mind of things only to return with
a vengeance when I stopped working that Friday. As I sat at home I couldn't
stop thinking about it. Subconsciously I dressed a little nicer that evening.
When I got out of the bedroom Travis even noticed and said "Wow, are you going
to seduce someone tonight?"

"Just the man I love," I replied with a smile.

After having dinner at our favorite restaurant we ended up in a club. It had
just opened and as Travis knew the owner we had been invited to come that
evening. The music was thumping and I could feel the bass in my stomach. The
dance floor was filled with people. To the right was a double door leading to
another bar area where the music was less loud, but the dance floor was the
main one. Travis went over to the bar to order us something to drink.

I was glad we had decided to take a taxi when we left home. We just stood there
for a moment taking it all in. "It's very beautiful," I said, "I like it here."
Travis nodded and took a sip from his beer. I had a white wine in my hands and
just looked around, slightly moving to the music.

My dress was rather low cut, in the back as well as in the front showing some
of my boobs. What Body-Glue isn't good for, I thought as I was slightly
dancing. I had to glue the front as it was rather loose and of course I didn't
want it to slide. The skirt itself was tight around my hips and ass. On my feet
I work 6 inch heels, which made my legs look beautiful I thought and by the
reaction men gave me I was right in thinking that. My hair was in a ponytail
with two strands on both sides of my face, two long earrings completed the
look.

Dressing like this always made me feel good about myself and more confident. As
we were standing there, every now and again talking loud to beat the volume of
the music a man came walking up to us. I took a sip from my wine and we started
talking.

"Hi, you're looking beautiful," the man said.

"And who are you?" I replied.

Travis interrupted "That's Shawn, he owns the place."

"Ah, nice to meet you. Do you normally tell women they are beautiful and does
it ever work?" I said to Shawn.

"Well, I don't know. The first time I said it. So I would have to ask you
whether it worked."

"I don't know," I replied, "Jury is not out yet."

"Ah, well then we will have to wait a little longer." He turned to Travis, "How
are you doing, Travis? Still working at the same place?"

"Yes, and thank you for the invite. There's quite the queue outside and it was
nice to be able to skip it."

"Anything for an old friend. Did he tell you we went to college together?" he
then said to me.

"Is that so? And which college would that be?" I replied.

"Oh Kingston," he said with sort of an air over him.

"Kingston? Than we went to the same college too. That's were we met, Travis and
I. So I'm wondering why didn't I see you there as Travis and I were in the same
year and I'm sure I would have seen you at least once in those four years."

"Oh, but you did. I was a little fatter back then, glasses and longer hair."

"You were that Shawn?"

"Yes, I am not afraid to admit it. I started exercising after college, eating
better and now here I am."

"You cleaned up nicely," I laughed. By that time my glass was empty and Shawn
offered to get us another round.

"If you want to dance with him, go ahead," Travis whispered in my ear. I just
looked at him a little confused. It wasn't what he said it was more the way he
said it. Sure Shawn was rather handsome now and his body looked nice, above all
he smelled great. Shawn returned with our drinks and as he handed me my wine he
had this look on his face. I could see his eyes going down to my chest and it
felt somehow nice to see him do it.

When he looked up again I just smiled at him and I might even have winked. I
don't really remember, but according to Travis I did. I finished my drink and
that's when Shawn asked me to dance, he held out his hand and I put mine in
his. He guided me to the floor where we danced. The DJ was playing some popular
music with heavy beats, this was when dance was popular. I had a lot of fun and
was so happy that I had used glue to keep my top to where it was supposed to
be.

Song after song was played and slowly the DJ changed into slower songs ending
with a ballad. Shawn put his arms around me and I put mine over his shoulders,
he was bigger than me but I didn't feel like I had to reach. During the song we
moved further to the middle of the dance floor. To a point where I couldn't see
Travis anymore. His hand went up to my naked back and feeling him touch me
there sent all kinds of sensations through my body. I was shocked by what I
felt, but didn't move away. His hand went up and down my back giving me
goosebumps all over.

He bent his head forward and just as our lips were about to touch, I turned my
head away. "No", I panted, "I can't do this." Pushing his arms away I took a
few steps back, looked at him for a moment and walked away. I saw Travis
sitting at the bar and simply said "We have to go." He asked me why and I
repeated what I had said. He got up, took my arm and we left.

At the house I told him what had happened but left out how I felt. He didn't
get angry or jealous, not at all. It was almost the opposite, he looked like he
enjoyed me talking about it. I was angry at first, at myself, at Travis. How
could he think of me like that?

"Tell me why you dressed the way you did?" He asked after we were quiet for a
while.

"Because I like it. It's a nice dress and it makes me look good." I replied

"That it is and it does make you look good. But -- you could have worn that new
dress you bought the other day. You know, the light one. But you didn't, you
chose this one. Why?"

"Oh, I don't know. I didn't feel like light salmon colors."

"Or wasn't it sexy enough for you? I mean this is all open in front and in the
back. You've only worn this one once before, when we went to the opening of
that musical, remember?"

"Yes, Les Miserables. A friend worked on the crew and she had gotten some
tickets to spare. She knew how much I wanted to see it and she gave them to
us. And it's called a premiere dear, not an opening."

"Whatever. All the women there were dressed like this, so why did you choose to
wear it tonight? It wasn't special and I would loved to have seen you in that
new one. To be perfectly honest, I don't really care what you wear, you look
beautiful in anything to me. So why did you choose this dress?"

I refused to talk about it any longer, this was getting crazy. Was he really
suggesting I put it on to seduce someone? To see men gawk at me as if I was
nothing more than a piece of meat? I felt betrayed, hurt and dirty.

I ran upstairs to our bedroom, took off that dress and changed into my
sweatshirt and a pair of yoga pants. I sat at my vanity taking out my earrings
and was about to start removing my makeup. I was so near crying than I almost
messed up and cleaned my face with nail polish remover. I put my head on my
arms and started to cry. That's when Travis walked in.

"Don't cry," he said softly, "Pleas don't cry. I wasn't trying to hurt you."

"You did," I sobbed, "You did. How can you think that off me? I am a loyal
wife, we took our vows and that means something to me."

"I know and it means a lot to me too. But Laura, you have to be honest with
yourself. It's the little things I see and it all leads op to one thing."

"And that is?"

"You like the attention you get. The first time I noticed I thought I had seen
it wrong. Then I noticed it again and again. I didn't say anything because I
don't care. I know that in the end you will be next to me in that bed." with
his head he gestured towards our bed. He was quiet for a moment before he said
"I like it when you unknowingly flirt with a guy. Flinging your hair, the
little gestures with your head, putting an extra bounce in your step, arcing
your back just a little more and most of all swaying your hips when you know
someone is walking behind us. It's those little things."

I just couldn't believe him. He was basically saying that I was flirting with
men right in front of him. For what? To make him jealous? I already knew he
wasn't the jealous type. He had proven that to me on multiple occasions. So why
then? Why would I do such a thing?

"So tell me," Travis said softly again, "Why did we have to leave all of a
sudden? You were on the dance floor and I couldn't see you anymore. So what
happened?"

"We were dancing to that slow song, he had his arms around me and then tried to
kiss me. I pushed him away and that was it. I wanted to leave."

"But the question is, and be honest now, did you want to kiss him?"

I felt a shock through my system. I felt myself turning white as if I was
caught doing something bad. I did want to kiss him, there was no other way
about it. I bowed my head and whispered "Maybe."

"Sorry, I didn't hear that," Travis said, "Did you say maybe?"

"I don't know," I huffed. Travis poked my arm a little to coach it out of me
then I just blurted it out "Yes, I wanted to kiss him. Your wife wanted to kiss
another man. There you have it. Are you happy now?"

"Yes, you are being honest now. Not just to me, but to yourself too."

I just stared at him and felt deflated, defeated and just empty. The secret was
out it felt like. And there he was, on his knees next to me: my loving husband
with his kind eyes looking at me. No sign of anger or jealousy, but warm eyes
and a slight smile as if to say I hadn't done anything wrong in his eyes. I put
my arms around him and started to cry again.

"I am so sorry," I cried, "I am so sorry. I won't ever do it again. I will not
dance with anyone ever again. I promise. I love you so much and I never want to
hurt you."

"I love you too, Laura. And you didn't hurt me, not even for a little bit.
Seeing you dance with another man makes me feel proud. Whenever you dance with
someone I thing *you get this dance man, but she's coming home with me*. It
makes me feel so proud that I can call you my wife. It makes me love you even
more."

"Do you mean that?" I said through my tears.

He nodded and said "Yes, I do. I want to give you all the space to be you, the
woman I fell in love with. The woman who doesn't care what other people think
and I am so grateful to Marisha that she taught you that."

"You are?"

"Oh yes. And I've heard all the stories about you in college. They told me you
were easy and suddenly that stopped. I've never asked you why because I felt
like you would tell me when you where ready and I still feel that way. I don't
care about your past, what you did before we met. I care about our past, our
current and our future, the ones we share. All I want is for you to be happy,
that's the most important thing for me."

I felt a wave, a tsunami of love coming my way. He had never made me *feel* his
love like he did at that moment. Of course he had heard about my *wild* period,
we were in the same year in college. And we didn't go to the biggest of them
and thus it would have been strange if he hadn't heard. And still he wanted to
meet me, get to know me, take it slow. Right after I stopped being that wild
girl I had been worried nobody would want to be with me just for me, Travis
proved me wrong. That was one of the many things I fell for.

"It was a Saturday and I wanted to go out, but Marisha had to study. So I went
alone, to Malone's. You know it, that one in Old Town. Well, I was dancing,
having fun and some guy chatted me up. We kissed, made out and then he invited
me over to his place. It wasn't that far and I felt a little special." I looked
at Travis and noticed he seemed to like hearing my story. Past boyfriends
didn't want to hear about the ones who went before them.

I took his hand and we sat down on the bed. I looked him in the eyes and said
"Well, we reach his apartment and when he opened the door there were about five
more guys inside. They handed me a bottle of vodka and I took a sip and another
and another. I started to kiss that guy from the bar again and he started to
undress me. I didn't protest and even helped him with my bra. We ended up in
the bed and remember the others were watching us. One might even have been
recording it, I don't really remember."

"Keep going," Travis said, "Tell me all the details. Get it out your system."

"I haven't told anyone this. Not a soul. That being recorded might have been in
my mind because I never come across any video of it at all, never. But I'm
still scared it will pop up somewhere. Back to the story. As I was saying we
were on that bed, I was fully naked by now, bent over and --"

"Go on say it. Tell me everything."

"I was -- I had his -- You know."

"No, tell me you had is what?"

"I had his penis in my mouth, alright? I was sucking his cock. I was bent over
with my ass towards the guys watching, the could see everything and I didn't
care at that moment. I lost myself and before I realized what was happening I
had five cocks around me and one inside me. One of them bent me over and pushed
it up my ass. I can still feel the pain. I screamed that he was hurting me, but
I just couldn't stop. I had sex with all of them, all night long. They came
everywhere, all over my body, inside my pussy and my ass. I was more than happy
to be their toy that night. When I woke up I felt dirty, used and taken
advantage off. I had crossed a line I wasn't ready for. So I got dressed and
got the heck out of there. Hours later I learned they were groomers, getting
girls ready for prostitution and this had been the initiation night. I had been
lucky to get out of there. Maybe because I was willing they didn't feel the
need to drug me or lock the door. As I said I had been extremely lucky. Weeks
later they all were arrested and 14 girls were rescued. They had been locked up
in the basement of that building and nobody even knew they were there."

"I think I read about that. Yes, I remember that. It was awful."

"Yes, that's what made me realize what I was doing. I was selling myself short
and I knew if I continued with what I was doing it could end up real bad. So I
stopped. Maybe it helped that I had done enough of it. Maybe it was some sort
of catching up. Before I went to college I truly believed in saving myself for
marriage. Until then I had never been with a boy before. But talking to Marisha
made me change my mind and I am still grateful. Everything that happened after
wasn't here fault. She even did her best to make me stop. She really did, but
the cork was out and once I started to like it, I *really* liked it."

Travis snickered and said "You can say that again. So tell me, who was the one
who got to get your virginity?"

"Oh, that was Angelo. It all went so natural. We were in his room because his
room mate was out of town. We kissed, made out and I told him I was a virgin.
He was so gentle and took his time with me. I was so nervous but I felt that I
was ready. Then all of a sudden it really happened. He got on top of me and I
was so scared. But again he took is time, slowly stretching me before he pushed
on. I can feel the sharp pain as I am thinking about it. When he was inside he
just stayed there for a minute or two so I could adjust. Then he started to
move, slide in and out ever so slow. The pain was replaced with pleasure and I
placed my hands on his hips, I curled my legs around him and he started to move
faster and faster. I came before I knew it. When it was over he had come on my
belly and I felt like a real woman for the first time in my life. No longer a
girl, no longer a virgin, a real woman."

"What happened after?"

"Well, we saw the blood on the sheets and I got scared again. We looked it up
in the books of his room mate, a medical student, and we learned that it was
normal for a woman to bleed a little at the first time. We put the book back
and I pushed him on the bed. I got on top of him and took his half hard penis
inside me again. I felt him getting hard inside me and it made me so horny. I
had broken my own vow and I wanted more. I wanted to go all the way and when he
was about to come again I pushed myself down on him, forcing him to come inside
me. I wanted it all, I needed it all. The weeks after were the most scary in my
life, yes I was on birth control but I knew all too well that it wasn't 100%
guaranteed. So when I finally got my period I was so happy and elated. Marisha
and I bought a jumbo package of condoms and I must have been to one that used
them all, or at least most of them. I never did it without, never. Until that
night I told you about. As I said I lost myself, didn't really know what I was
doing. It just went from one thing to the other."

"Wow, that's quite the story," Travis said, "So Angelo kissed you. Like this?"

He kissed me and I nodded. "And like this," I replied and kissed him. Slowly we
reenacted my first time. Ever move was commented with a "like this" "Then he
got on top of me and I felt his cock against my vulva, he kept it there for a
while slowly going up and down my labia, just like that yes." When Travis
slowly pushed forward I let go of a little shriek, just like I did back then.
It was the best feeling in the world I had, I was telling my husband how I lost
my virginity in all it's details and he acted them out with me. It seemed to
turn him on a lot and I am sure he got harder than he had ever been before. And
when he finally exploded over my belly I am so sure I hadn't seen him come so
hard before.

Afterwards we laughed and giggled, kissed and made out. We feel asleep in each
others arms and I felt more connected to him than I had ever felt before. He
was the one I had no more secrets for, he knew them all even the one of one of
the worst nights in my life, the one I had been so lucky to have escaped from.
