# Fort Dix
Fort Dix is the biggest city in the country with almost 16 million citizens,
but it's not the capital of the country. That's Wilmington, named after the
first president of the country.

## History
Fort Dix was founded by the first settlers who came over in _the Silent Bell_,
the sailed into the bay and settled a bit more land inwards for it's mountains
offered a natural protection from the elements.

50 years after the settlement was fortified and thus got its name: Fort Dix.
Where the name Dix came from is a matter of controversy up until this date. The
most popular idea is that it's named after the local native tribe that resided
in this area at the time.

## District where Laura lives
Laura lives on the outskirts of _Old Dixie_, where she moves into an apartment
owned by her fathers best friends, who bought it for his daughter but she
recently moved out. The apartment is largely furnished and because of this
rent is on the cheap side compared to other apartments in the area.
