# Magnolias
*an erotic tale by Transgirl*

## Chapter One
The music was turned up high and the beats were thumping, I could feel them in
my belly, making me ever more anxious than I already was. Why did I ever agree
to do this? Yes, I wanted some more excitement in our lives, but this felt like
going too far to soon. I just didn't feel ready and sat there at the bar rather
uncomfortable. I didn't belong in a place like this and what if I ran into
someone that I knew? What was I going to tell them? The more I thought about it
the more I just wanted to leave.

Going to the bathroom was my only escape, in there I could feel a little more
safe, for as long as it lasted. When could I get out of there? I had promised
to stay for at least an hour and I never knew time could go this slow. I seemed
like everything had slowed down, all I heard was the beat of the music like the
rhythm of a heart, my heart. I got more and more nervous, feeling like I could
throw up at any moment.

My thoughts went back to the moment we had agreed to do this. We had been
married for just over five years and it had become a runt, a daily grind of
going to work, coming home, doing the chores and repeating all of it the next
day. We had moved to the suburbs where we totally were dependent on our cars.
Just going to the grocery store was a trip taking forty minutes. Gone were the
days we could simply walk to a store as we did when we lived downtown. But as
with all marriages we wanted to start a family and buying a house seemed like a
good idea for starters.

To spice up our lives we tried different things, going for romantic dinners, to
the movies, date-nights. In the bedroom we spiced it up as well. Role play, a
little BDSM, watching adult entertainment together, nothing really seemed to
work for the both of us. And I had to admit watching those videos didn't do a
lot for me. Only when we came across videos of real people sharing their
stories something struck me and it struck him even more. It was a video of a
woman sleeping with a another man for the first time as her husband not only
watched but also recorded it. The look on her face when this man penetrated her
as she held the hand of her husband was what did it for me.

We watched video after video, talked about it, he even got me some toys in
different sizes. We started to fantasize about it. How I would go to a bar and
pick up a guy, take him back to the hotel and, well you know what comes next.
The more we talked about it the more we wanted to try it for real, or he wanted
to try it. I never felt quite ready, but I wanted to please him too. I was
willing to cross a line, climb an obstacle just to make him happy.

But as I was actually sitting there all my doubts returned with a vengeance. It
felt wrong, it felt like I was cheating and I became so afraid this would ruin
our marriage. I just couldn't do it. I got out my phone and texted him our safe
word: Magnolias.

Within seconds he messaged back that he was outside in the parking lot. I got
my purse, my jacked and I bolted out of there. In a state of panic I looked
around as I didn't see him. Then I recognized someone, he was standing next to
the car and waving. I ran up to him and got in the passenger seat. "Take me
home," was all I could say.

We had been quite all the way back home. As I sat down at our kitchen table all
the emotions came out at once. Anger, rage, regret and pain. Pain for letting
him down, regret that I just couldn't do it, rage and anger because I had been
such a wuss. I looked up to my left to the flowers in the vase: Magnolias. He
had bought me a bouquet of magnolias. Seeing those made me laugh and I looked
up at my husband.

"A joke," he said, "I knew you couldn't do this. That's why I didn't go inside
and waited for you. But I have to give you this one: you were in there for
almost one and a half hour. So you won the challenge."

"As if that was what we were there for," I replied, "I am so sorry, I just
panicked. I just didn't feel ready. All I could think about was why I was even
there. I was so scared to run into someone. What was I going to tell them?"

"Here," he said as he handed back my wedding ring, "put it back on. I admire
you for trying, maybe we have to rethink this a little bit. Maybe going to a
bar here wasn't the best idea. We could go somewhere else, like to the other
side of the country. You always wanted to go to For Dix, didn't you? Well,
let's go there. Let's make a weekend out of it or maybe even a week."

For Dix isn't only the capital, it is the largest city too. Started as a
colony, it became a fort, then a city. It has lots of history and somehow I
always wanted to go there, to see all the sights and enjoy everything Fort Dix
had to offer. Maybe it was a good idea to try it there, at least the chance of
me bumping into someone I know as next to zero if it wasn't zero at all.

I put my arms around him saying "I am so sorry, Travis. I really tried."

"I know Laura, I know. Don't feel so bad, we tried and now we know that this
isn't the way. We will think of something, we will find a way to make that
fantasy come true. Don't you worry about it."

It had been months since that night and all had returned to the daily grind, we
both had very demanding jobs and worked long hours. We did try to get pregnant,
but it never got so far. I talked to girl friends about it and one of them said
it could be related to the stress I was in. "Maybe if you just relaxed more,
take a vacation or something. Let your body rest for a while. I've heard enough
stories of couples getting pregnant while they were on a holiday. I'm not
joking."

I checked it online and according to multiple medical sites stress did have a
negative effect on getting pregnant. When I talked to Travis about it he sprang
into action and two days later he had booked a hotel in For Dix for a week. All
I had to do was get some time off from work. That was easier said than done, we
were in the crucial stages of a big deal and I was needed to complete it. All I
could do was postpone the holiday, multiple times there was always something
preventing me from taking time off.

The day I learned my colleagues, who were as essential as I was, did get time
off I almost exploded. I ran into my boss's office and demanded an explanation.
"Well, you're a junior. They aren't." was what he said to me. A junior? I had
been working there for longer than the three who were promoted. I did the same
work, got better evaluations and still I wasn't promoted.

Now, I know fully well that I am speaking from a place of luxury as we could
survive quite easy from my husbands salary alone. So I know this isn't
something anyone could do, but I quit right there at that moment. This was just
the drop in the proverbial bucket. The look on his face when I told him that I
was quitting was priceless. He was totally shocked by my sudden explosion.
"What?!" I shouted, "You promoted Tom and Dylan. Even though they have less
experience than I have. My evaluations are great, every single time. I seemed
to be liked by everyone and I would have made a wonderful manager. Is it
because I'm a woman? Huh? Is it because I have a womb? Is that it? I've asked
for a week off for months now. And every time it's something. Now it was that I
was needed for the O'Leary account. Well, David works on that account too. He
is maybe even more important for that account than I am. And he get's two weeks
off to go the Bahama's? He's not even married, so why is it that he gets time
off? This is it, I can't take this any longer. I quit! You will have my
resignation letter within the hour. I expect my last paycheck to be ready when
I leave, if not than you will hear from my lawyer."

I turned around in the doorway. "And did I tell you my husband is my lawyer?
Maybe you've heard of him. Travis Willingham, you know, the one from Willingham
and Riegel. The firm that beat the government last week? Yes, that one."

Walking out of there felt good and frightening at the same time. As I walked
out all the women stood up and applauded. They had the same experiences as I
had and a few days later I learned that almost 20 of them quit after me. As
they couldn't fill the positions quick enough they lost some major accounts. As
far as I know the company policy has changed now and women have an equal chance
of getting promoted as men have. At least something good had come out of it, I
thought when I read that news on Facebook.

The first thing Travis said when I told him was how proud he was off me. "You
stood up against injustice and you did something about it. You might not
realize it now, but you've never been happy working there. That happy go lucky
girl I fell in love with wasn't there anymore. But I know how stubborn you can
be, you would never have listened to me. Remember how angry you got when I
tried to tell you to quit? Oh no, miss independent over here didn't want the be
dependent on me. I never want you to be dependent on me, I just want you to be
happy. To do something you really like to do. So why don't we go on that
holiday, rest and think of something you can do? Maybe start your own little
business, be your own boss."

I don't know how I got this lucky with a man like Travis, he always knew
exactly what to say to make me feel better. How could such a jock have such a
kind heart? He loved his football games, his cage fights, but he cried way more
easy watching movies than I did. That was what made me fall in love with him,
he wasn't scared to show his emotions and still be a strong, muscular man. To
me him having that big of a heart, made him even stronger.

He proved that once and for all to me. I was walking back from the ATM when
some guy grabbed me from behind, placing a knife to my throat. I still to this
day don't know where he came from, but suddenly I saw this arm whisk right next
to my head. Travis hit him right in the face, I can still hear the cracking of
his nose. The knife dropped as did the guy who tried to rob me. "Call the
police," Travis shouted as he got on top of the guy, rolling him over pushing
one arm high up his back. The robber squealed in pain.

It took the police almost ten minutes to arrive, I kicked the knife away and
was in a total state of panic. A woman rushed up to me as she spoke to 911.
"Yes, I've got her. Someone punched the scumbag to the ground. Is he your
husband?" I nodded. "Wow, I've never seen someone move so fast. He sure loves
you honey."

When the police took over I ran into his arms, couldn't stop crying and all
Travis said was "I got you. I'm here for you, always." Travis talked to the
police and told them what had happened. Someone had recorded it on their phone
and showed it to them. Travis was cleared as he was clearly protecting his wife
and even got compliments from the officers that were there.

And now he was there for me once more, supporting me and proving to me how much
he loved me. I felt so grateful for him once again. What did I ever do to
deserve him? I crawled into his open arms and told him how much I loved him. "I
know, Laura, I know." he said with his deep voice.

The next day I woke up at the same time I normally would. Travis was already up
and getting ready for work. On auto pilot I got up to and stumbled into our
bathroom. "Why are you up?" he said. I looked at him and suddenly realized I
didn't have to. I didn't have a job anymore. "Oh yes, I remember now." I turned
around and got back into bed.

As I laid down again my body started to shiver. I felt cold and warm at the
same time, felt like was getting a cold. I didn't say anything and wished
Travis a good day at work. My body just couldn't stop shaking and I started to
feel sick. After laying in bed for a few hours, I got up and put on my
bathrobe, I felt so miserable I laid down on the couch. Around noon I called a
friend who happened to be a doctor.

"Hey Marisha, can we talk for a moment?"

"Quick, I've got a patient in ten minutes. What's up?"

"Well, I quit my job yesterday --"

"Finally! Go on."

I was surprised by her reaction but continued. "And now I feel sick, hot and
warm, my whole body shakes. Do I need to see my doctor about this?"

"Well, firstly I am your doctor and secondly I am speaking as a friend now not
as your doctor, okay? To me it seems that you've been under a lot of stress,
for a prolonged period of time. And now you are getting rest and your body is
telling you that this was long overdue. Tell you what? If you still feel like
this tomorrow come and see me, professionally and we can do some tests."

"Thank you, could you come by later today?"

"Sure, I'm off around six. Be there around seven, okay?"

"Thanks, see you then."

Speaking to her had reassured me enough that I even started to feel a little
better. Perhaps she was right, perhaps this was all just stress related. Maybe
I had ignored myself for too long. I just stayed on that couch watching TV all
day. Around seven Marisha walked in. "So, where's my patient?" she said with a
laugh. We talked for over an hour until Travis came home.

"Well, I'm sure it's just stress," Marisha said, "This can last a while,
depends mostly on the person so I can't tell you how long. Just start doing fun
things, get off that couch and do something active. You always liked to hike,
didn't you? Why don't you do that? Take up that hobby again, you know
photography? That thing you always loved to do and were damn good at."

I started to chuckle "Okay, okay, doc. I will. Going for a hike actually seems
like a lovely idea. I haven't done that for a long time."

The next day after Travis had left I got into my car and drove to the park just
north of our town. As I hadn't walked a trail for so long I chose to start with
the shortest one. Just being there, outside in nature, seeing all the beauty
made me feel a lot better, so much better that by the time I was back at the
car I was almost glad I had quit. During that walk it all became clear to me,
every single sexist remark, every single time a man was promoted over a woman,
ever time a man got all the praise for the work I had done. I was almost glad
because I mostly got angry. Angry at myself for condoning it, angry at them for
doing it, angry at myself for just walking away instead of fighting it.

It was that day I learned on Facebook that other women had quit over the same
reasons after me. I messaged them and they thanked me for standing up and
showing them that it was not acceptable. Hearing that made me feel even better.
"Don't feel bad because you quit. I quit because you showed me how to quit. I
wanted to leave for so long. When I talked to my partner he told me to quit
too. So I did, just like you did." was one of the responses.

Finally I felt like I had taken my revenge and that is had been a good thing I
got out of there when I did. Fighting it would have lead to more stress and
maybe even to worse things physically. They made me realize I didn't have a
choice anymore and when I closed the laptop I had finally reached that point of
acceptance.

Day after day I felt better and better. I went for a walk every single day and
started taking photo's again. Flowers, birds, landscapes, details of buildings
I started to notice. I just couldn't get enough of it. In the evenings when
Travis was working late I spent time on adjusting them. Lighting, colors and
everything else I could do.

When I finally had a photo almost perfect I skipped to Travis, took his hand
and showed it to him. "Look, look, I did it. Isn't it perfect." It was a photo
of a magnolia, the balance between the whites and the greens was just
perfect.

"Wow, did you take that one?" he asked. I just nodded. "Wow, that could be in a
magazine. Why don't you try to sell them? I've heard of this site where artists
can show off their work and companies interested can buy their products. Why
don't you look into that? You love photography and you're damn good at it."

"Really? You think I could do that?"

"Why not? You won't know until you try."

I sat down at the laptop again and searched for a site like Travis had
mentioned. I read their documentation and their frequently asked questions. I
was a little taken away by the amount of money they withheld from every sale,
but you have to start somewhere they say. After comparing a couple of sites, I
chose the one with the best reviews which happened to be the biggest site of
all of them.

I registered an account and chose the free plan at first. It did mean they
would take a larger percentage, but at least it didn't cost us anything when
things wouldn't work out. I completed my bio, uploaded a nice photo of myself
and completed what they called 'Your Portfolio'. I was rather pleased with the
result, now came the hard part. Selection photos to upload and figuring out
what I thought they would be worth.

The next day I spent all day at my laptop, looking at photos others were
offering and noting the prices they asked. I didn't want to be overpriced nor
to cheap. At the end of the day I had made ten photos available for purchase,
one of them was the magnolia photo.

Via the site I came into contact with others and we shared tips and tricks how
to make the photos even better. One of them sold photos for big prices and he
was more than happy to share. I took classes from professional photographers,
learned how to make beautiful landscapes, detailed photos and portraits. I also
learned to technical aspects like developing film, exposure and working in a
dark room. I felt energized and couldn't wait to tell Travis all that I had
done or learned that day.

He was so happy to see me this excited again, especially when I sold my very
first photo. It was my magnolia picture and it was later used by some website
to complete an article they published. Seeing my name underneath the article
was a very special moment. "Photo by Laura Davis. All rights reserved." I took
a screenshot and mailed it to family and friends.

During our holiday to Fort Dix I took hundreds if not thousands of photos.
Travis joked that I was experiencing the city through a lens. He loved to see
me that excited though. And yes, I had some days where I left the camera at the
hotel. Somehow I felt naked without it, but I wanted to be there with the man I
loved. We had a wonderful time seeing all the sites, taking in the culture of
that city, eating at the best restaurants and taking strolls on the beach in
the evenings. "I could see myself living here," I said as a joke.

Travis stopped walking, looked at me and said "I was thinking the same thing.
Sam and I have been talking and maybe it's time for me to move on. I've done
all this corporate stuff for so long now, it's not a challenge anymore. Sam is
willing to buy me out. With that money I could easily open my own office here,
you could become a photographer. I mean all the stock I have, we wouldn't have
to worry about money ever again. So why don't we both slow down and start
living again? What do you say?"

"But you love working with Sam."

"I do, I really do. We've known each other for so long now. It's just, I can
dream the cases now, there's no more challenge. Although we never know how a
judge or a jury will decide, it's always the same boring corporate stuff. I
could take some classes, pass the bar and become a defense lawyer here. Like I
wanted to do when I was in law school."

"But it would mean we are leaving our friends and family behind."

"Yes, but it's a three hour flight. And be honest, with her being a doctor how
often do you see Marisha any way. If we live here she has to stay for at least
a day, if not longer. And there's something called the internet."

I chuckled "You're right, as always. Let's think about it, let's not take quick
decisions. This is way to big for that. Let's calm down and think about it."

"Okay, how long?"

"Until we've really thought it through." Travis nodded and we continued
walking. I put my arms around him and took a deep breath. I couldn't remember
the last time I had been this happy.

When we were back in hour hotel room Travis said "Have we thought about it for
long enough now? Because I've made up my mind."

I chuckled and said "Let it sink in for a while. I'm not so sure yet. Yes, this
is a lovely town and yes I could see myself living here. But we also have a
nice thing going now. Do we really want to risk it all? On a whim, an urge?"

"Yes, how can we ever know if we don't try? If we don't do it now it might
never happen at all and we might regret that later in life. I don't want such
regret. If it doesn't work out, we at least tried."

"There you go again being all reasonable. Stop that. It makes me feel
uncomfortable." I chuckled. Deep inside I knew he had a point, but the fear of
it all going wrong was stronger. I just needed some more time to make up my
mind.

"Just don't take to long," Travis said, "Or you might have to take long flights
to come and see me." I threw a pillow at him, but he ducked away into the
bathroom just too quickly.

After we came home again the thought of moving never left me. The more I
thought about it the more I wanted to go. He was right about everything. If Sam
did buy him out we wouldn't have to worry about money ever again. They had
started their firm literally from our bedroom. I chuckled thinking back to that
little, one-bedroom apartment we shared, we weren't even married then. Travis
proposed to me when they won their first case. From that moment forward their
firm skyrocketed. Sam, who was more business savvy, convinced Travis to put
some of their money into stocks, both owning 50 percent of them.

They had looked at every angle and doing so wasn't illegal as long as they
didn't invest in clients. Whenever they owned stock and that company became a
client, they sold all of what they owned to avoid conflicts of interest or
insider trading claims. They always made sure the stocks were sold before a
contract was signed.

When there were claims of insider trading the SEC inspected their books and
always cleared them of wrong doing. The same was true for the BAR association.
I was present during one of those negotiations.

"This is a good case for us to take on," Sam said, "But, there is one problem.
We own stock in your company and we can't talk specifics as long as we own that
stock. Before we sign anything, before you go into details we need to sell our
stock. And no you can't tell us anything about it, that would be insider
trading and that's not something either of us want to deal with. So, come back
tomorrow, we will have sold our stock and read up on this case. Then we can
decide whether you want us to represent you. Is that a good plan?"

If it hadn't been for their reputation I don't believe any of the companies
would have accepted that. They would just go to another firm. When the visitors
had left I wanted to speak up but Sam gestured for me to be quiet. He clicked a
button under the desk he was sitting at, waited for a few seconds and said "We
record everything, just to be sure. If you had spoken I would have had to
explain why you were here. Now I can tell them that you were just an intern who
was sitting in to see how it goes. That you aren't involved in this case one
way or the other."

"Ah, that also answered my question."

"That's how I roll. Come, Travis should be back from court any minute now. I
hope he has some good news."

Sam was a shrewd lawyer and he knew it. His self-confidence oozed out of him,
without getting arrogant. He always knew how to make jokes about himself.
"Don't you know that I'm fabulously rich?" he always said with a twinkle in his
eye. He flirted with women, but never went too far as he was very happily
married and didn't ever want to do anything to hurt her. Not after what they
went through in New York, they saw the towers fall. She even took photos of the
planes hitting the tower.

When they arrived in New Jersey, they were still covered with the dust off the
towers. They had heard the thumps of bodies hitting the ground. That experience
had welded a bond between them that simply couldn't be broken. You could see
the love in his eyes whenever he talked about her, the only woman that had been
able to tame him.

I respected him for it so much and he always made me laugh. He not only was
Travis' best friend, he was mine too. Thinking about leaving him and Marisha to
go live in Fort Dix was the only thing that kept me from getting on that plane.

"Marisha, Sam, thank you for coming," I said as we sat down at a table in my
favorite coffee shop. "I've been struggling with something and I need both your
advise. You are both my best friends, besides Travis that is. But this is
something I need you two for."

I was quiet for a moment before I spoke again. "As you know Sam Travis wants to
open his own little office and move into criminal law. And I know he talked to
you about it."

"Yes, he did. And I offered him a way out."

"A very generous one," I responded, "Well, when we were in For Dix I said I
could live there as a joke. But he was serious about it. With the money you
offered we could actually do this."

"So, why don't you?" Marisha interrupted.

"Because it would mean I -- we would be so far apart. I am so afraid I'm going
to miss you two. That's what's holding me back."

Sam turned to Marisha and said "I can see how that is an issue. If only there
was a solution. Like some sort of transportation that would make this a lot
easier."

"Yeah," Marisha replied, "but I just can't think what that could be? I mean
driving takes far too long, walking even longer."

"If I dove into the river, take a left at some point. Crossed the mountains,
swam for another few days I could get there."

"Good point, but there has to be something easier, quicker. Like going through
the sky."

"Through the sky? You are joking, can we do that?"

"Yes, I've read about it. Two guys invented something that enables us to fly."

"Really? When?"

"Oh, almost a hundred years ago."

"That long? Wow." Sam turned to me "Get our point?"

I started laughing and said "Yes, I get the point. I think I just needed to
hear it from you two. You could have left out the whole charade though."

"Why?" Marisha chuckled, "That wouldn't have been fun."

"Thank you, the both of you. I think I might make Travis happy tonight. I think
we're moving to Fort Dix."

Marisha cheered "Yay, can I come over when you're settled? Do you have a room
for me?"

"Always, I love you both so much."

## Chapter Two
Our new apartment was just so beautiful. The locations was just perfect, just
outside of *Old Town*, the city center of Fort Dix. There were shops and
restaurants everywhere as this part of town was still very much kept in the
European way of city design. The further out you got the wider the roads got
and the more it started to look like anywhere else in the country.

We had chosen this area on purpose. Having lived in the suburbs had made us
realize we didn't want that anymore. The mere fact we could walk to a grocery
store was like being in heaven for us and I wondered why not all cities were
build this way. The street we were living on was even closed for traffic except
for the people who lived there. And as there wasn't any parking spots along the
street there wasn't any traffic.

We had sold our old house, our cars and everything else we either couldn't or
didn't want to bring with us. The sale of all the stocks combined with half the
worth of the old law firm made it able for us to never have to worry about
money ever again.

Just days after Travis had passed the BAR, he opened his law office and his
first clients. Small cases but he was happy. Slowly he started to make a name
for himself and the caseload rose with it. Bigger cases, more exposure. But he
was just one lawyer, with one clerk who helped him. Ashley was a nice girl and
we got along real well.

My photos started to sell, but it was rather slow and I thought long and hard
about how I could change that. One day I took a photo of her and asked if she
minded if I tried to sell it online. That photo sold almost immediately.

When I told Ashley about it she blushed "Who me? You are joking who wants a
photo of me?"

"Well, Woman's Day apparently."

"Woman's Day? Am I going to be in Woman's Day?"

"I don't know," I replied matching her enthusiasm, "But they bought the photo."

We agreed to do a series and we had a lovely day with lot's of laughter doing
it. I took lot's of photos of her in different outfits. Some of them sold,
others not so much. We started to more shoots in different locations, she was
just so good in front of the camera. On my advice she registered with an agency
and it didn't take long for her to become a serious model. Not that she
traveled the world, but she got contracts for ads and even a commercial. "It's
just a nice hobby," she said.

In the mean time I got some jobs with some magazines and news papers after I
had registered as an independent photographer. I worked free lance only as I
didn't want to be an employee anymore. Being my own boss was just perfect for
me and it gave me the freedom to decline offers too.

I went to parties, concerts, weddings and even some big news worthy conferences
with world leaders. My name as a photographer was rising and I just couldn't
have been more happy.

The first time Marisha came over to visit I took her with me on a job, she
loved seeing me work. Afterwards I showed her the city. "It's nice to see you
this happy again," she said as we were having dinner, "How's things with
Travis?"

"Alright, he's very busy as an attorney. His little firm is taking off too.
He's even thinking about hiring another lawyer. I just hope he isn't going to
work long hours again, not like it was back home. We came here to slow down,
you know?"

"Did you tell him that?"

"How could I? I'm working a lot too. But that's mainly because I don't want to
be home alone all day."

"I really think you should tell him. If you don't how will he know? You seem
happy, he's happy. He could just think everything is okay the way it is."

"You might be right. I will talk to him, but not while you are here. What if we
get into a fight? I don't want you to be in the middle of it."

"That's fair," Marisha replied, "Just promise me you will talk to him. He's
earned it."

"I promise."

As fast as the jobs came, as fast as they dried up. I still was selling photos
through the site, I even had upgraded my account to get more options. But the
fast flow I had been in wasn't there anymore. I still did some weddings and
concerts, but missing some essential photos other photographers did get made me
less appealing for news outlets. I realized I just wasn't cutout to be a news
photographer.

One day I was contacted by a publisher. They told me how much they loved the
portraits I had done and if I would want to come talk to them. My nerves were
raging as I sat in the lobby of a very nice office building. A woman with very
nice hair, dressed in an immaculate suit and a draped skirt asked me to follow
her. She led me into the best meeting room I had ever seen.

Not long after a very handsome man walked in and sat down next to me, not
across from me, but next to me. It felt a little uncomfortable at first but his
whole demeanor was welcoming and warm.

"So nice to meet you," he said, "I'm Ezra, the head of scouting. We saw your
photos online and loved what you did with the portraits. Now we did try to
strike a deal with the model too, but she declined. She was way to busy with
work she said."

"That's Ashley for you." I replied.

"It seems so," he chuckled, "but then we got to thinking. Those photos were
made by you and that's why they came onto our radar. Now, we do have to ask for
some discretion from your part as what we will discuss here can be seen as
problematic to some people. Tell me have you ever thought about venturing into
glamour photography?"

"Glamour?"

"Yes, a little more -- nudity?"

"Nudity? You mean, nudes?"

"Well, yes. We publish one of the biggest magazines for men. And all of our
photographers are men too. We'd love to see how a woman would create them, a
female touch so to say."

"I don't know. Never thought about it before. Nudes? Dirty pictures you mean?"

"No, absolutely no genitals. But a little more skin, maybe even topless. But
classy photos. Like a beautiful woman on the beach, for example. Or sheets
draped around her body, you name it. We could talk to you about the assignment
and you would have full creative control. You would work with professional
models and with amateurs. We have a series called "This is my wife", where
women can apply for a shoot. But only if their partner agrees. We interview
her, about her youth, her life. We accompany those articles with some beautiful
photos and they decide how far they are willing to go."

"But those photos are always changed, manipulated."

"Not ours, we show women in all shapes and sizes. We want to show the beauty of
a woman, not a fantasy. That's why so many women work for us, we respect women.
I might be the head of scouting, but Sophia, the woman who picked you up, is
the head of design. It was her turn to bring you here, nobody here is more
important than the other. We are all needed to make this work."

"But someone has to make the decisions."

"That's true. I have the final say on hiring, Sophia when it comes to design,
others in their field. But we almost always come to an agreement."

"Although you make it seem so nice, I will have to think about this. I never
thought about doing this and I will have to discuss this with my husband. He's
a lawyer and I don't want to do anything that will either hurt or damage his
reputation."

"That's fair. You could always work under an alias. We will register that alias
and still pay you what is owned. We can even talk about licensing, that way you
would still own the copyright. Which would mean you also get a percentage of
the amount of magazines sold. Or we could make the deal that we pay you a fixed
amount for the job and the copyright is ours."

"Gosh, I really don't know. Can I think about this?"

"Sure, but we need an answer by next Friday. There's a shoot in Hawaii where we
want you for. We have the perfect model, a housewife from Toronto, but she only
wants to work with a woman. This way we will still have some time to find
someone else. And just to make sure how much we want to work with you, you are
the very first we thought of."

"That's surely flattering, but I really need some time."

"I understand. Thank you for coming and I hope we will hear from you soon. I
need to go now but Sophia will escort you back to the lobby. Again, thank you
for entertaining us."

As Sophia picked me up she asked "And? Are you considering this offer?"

"I don't know yet. Glamour? Never really thought about it."

Sophia stopped and said "Neither did I. But when I applied to be in *this is my
wife* I got to know these people. They don't want porn, they want classy
beautiful photos. When I told my parents what I was going to do, they were
horrified. Their daughter naked in a magazine? What would everybody think?
Until they saw the photos. They bought all the magazines they could get and
handed them out. "This is our daughter," they said. I didn't show anything
that I didn't want to show. All you could see was my back, heck I wear dresses
that show more skin than I showed in those photos. It's just because they
appear in a magazine for men that they are called glamour, that's all. Let me
ask you this? Do you ever wear a bikini?"

"Sure, when I go to the beach."

"So why is it that that's perfectly fine, but a photo of you in that same
bikini in a magazine for men, isn't?"

"Good question. Never thought of it that way."

"Well, now we can have a woman take those photos. Give them a female touch."

"You've given me a lot to think about. Thank you and it was nice meeting you."

"Same here, drive safely."

On the way back home everything went through my head again, especially what
Sophia had said. However I turned or twisted it I always came to the same
conclusion. I wouldn't do this without Travis' consent. I would have to talk to
him about this and about the other thing. As soon as I walked into our door I
texted him. "Can you come home early? I need to talk to you."

It was only three when Travis stormed in. "What's wrong? Did I do something?"

"No, no," I chuckled, "I am so sorry if I scared you."

"Phew, you startled me. So what's up?"

"Well, two things and please don't get angry I just want to tell you how I
feel."

"Okay, promised."

"We came her to slow down, didn't we?" Travis nodded. "Well, you are working
almost the same hours as you did back home. I just wanted to let you know,
that's all. If this is your way of slowing down, then we have different
definitions of the word."

"Spoken like a true lawyer," Travis chuckled.

"Learned from the best. Sam is such a good teacher." I laughed.

"Sam? What about me?"

"You're okay too. But hey, it's Sam we're talking about. He's fabulously rich,
don't you know?"

"Touche. And yes you're right. I've noticed it too, that's why I didn't take
any new cases. I've got one big one and I really need to concentrate on that
one. So, just another week or two and I will slow down again. Thank you for
noticing too and even more, thank you for telling me."

"You're welcome. Now the other thing. You know I had that meeting today, didn't
you?"

"Oh yes, how did that go?"

"Well, that's why I need to talk. It's not quite what I expected."

"No? Then why are we talking about it."

"Because it's a good deal we could make. I could do the jobs they offer, keep
the copyright of the photos and get a percentage of the magazines they sell."

"Okay, and how much would that be?"

"I don't know yet. I thought it unwise to talk details without talking to you
first. You are a lawyer and could help me with the negotiations. There is just
one thing."

"Which is?"

"It's glamour photos. You know of women for a magazine for men. Nudity."

"Ah, do you happen to ask which magazine?"

"Oh God no. I was so overwhelmed I totally forgot. But I talked to Sophia,
she's the head of design. She told me how her parents were so scared when she
told hem she was going to model. When they saw the photos though they bough all
the magazines they could get and handed them out like cookies. They were so
proud."

"That's a nice story, but is it true?"

"That I don't know. But she asked me a question and that really made me think.
What do I wear when I go to the beach?"

"I don't know, a bikini?"

"Yes, why is that perfectly fine and having photos published of me in that same
bikini isn't? I mean there are men on the beach when I'm there. The all can see
me in it. So what's the difference?"

"Never though about it that way. I guess there isn't a difference, come to
think about it."

"Exactly! And did I tell you that they want me for a shoot in Hawaii? We could
go to Hawaii, make a week out of it where I go to work for a day and we could
have some quality time together."

"Hawaii? Wow. That's quite the offer."

"It is. But I don't want to do it if you are not 100% behind it. I mean I could
always publish under an alias, but you as well as I know that isn't perfectly
secure. Someone will find out, one way or the other. And I don't want to lie to
our friends about it either."

"Yes, I see what you mean. But why would your work hinder mine?"

"Well, some clients might not like that I'm doing this. Some might have a big
problem with it."

"Than I don't want to represent them any way. They should not let what you do
decide if they want me to represent them. That decision should be based upon
what I do."

"Wow. Do you really mean that?"

"Yes, as you said we came here to slow down. I've worked cases I didn't really
want to do for long enough. One of the main reasons I wanted to stop working
with Sam. I can't defend clients who are doing things I don't agree with
anymore. No matter how good the money is. I felt like I was selling my soul.
The clients who I represent now are truly innocent, I can proof it. They are
just fighting against a machine with all the power. I love being the sand that
stops the motor."

"Who's being a lawyer now?" I laughed.

We talked some more and even came up with a strategy. Travis would come with me
to the next meeting and we would try and get the best deal possible. We hugged,
went out for dinner and just had a nice evening together.

The next day I called the publisher and we scheduled a meeting for the day
after. That meeting went as well as could be expected. What they offered us was
total ownership of all the photos, 25,000 dollars a shoot and five percent of
all magazines with my photos sold. This deal would mean that all costs that I
made would be for us, nothing would be arranged for me to get there. But the
simple fact that I still would be my own boss and I would keep the copyright on
all my photos meant more to me than anything else.

"Does this include reprinting?" Travis asked as he was going through the
contract.

"Yes," Sophia said, "Whenever we reprint a photo we will oblige by the contract
and pay you the 5 percent of all sold copies."

"Then I thin we can make this deal." Travis said with a smile, "I think you can
sign this, Laura. I don't see any problems with this contract." He turned to
Sophia and said "If, and only if, you change article 3, subsection e to include
all future reprints of the photos. And we do mean ALL future reprints."

"I will make sure the changes are made, please wait a moment for our legal team
to make those changes." She got up, walked out and five minutes later she
returned. "Do you want another coffee? Or tea? No. Okay, well let me then say
how happy I am you're on board with this Laura. I am so excited about this and
I can't wait for the photos you will take of me."

"You? Are you the model?"

"Yes, I am. My husband's idea. Dave? Dave, can you come in here?"

The man I had talked to in the first meeting walked in. "This is my husband
Dave. We met when I started working here. We were with three people back then,
mainly publishing catalogs for online shops. It was when I could convince them
to buy TMZ when it all skyrocketed."

"TMZ?" Travis burst out, "TMZ? Really?" I stared at him a little confused and
Travis said "Only the biggest magazine for men in the country?"

I had a suspicious look on my face and he quickly said "Oh, I only bought them
for the interviews. Like all men do."

I burst into laughter and so did Sophia and Dave, who said "That's the excuse
we hear from all our *readers*." A paralegal came in, handed Sophia the changed
contract which Travis quickly checked and I signed. We had officially struck a
deal.

"Now, why don't we go get dinner together and I can explain our ideas for this
shoot." Sophia said, "I am so looking forward to this."

The shoot wouldn't be for a few weeks, plenty of time for me to inform our
family and friends. My mother had it the hardest with the news. "Mom, it's not
that I'm going to be in the pictures. I'm just the one making them. It's good
money mom and we get to go to Hawaii."

"I guess that's true. I'm just a bit worried, that's all. You hear so many
horror stories about -- well -- that industry."

"It's not porn, mom. The woman wants classy pictures, beautiful photos. Yes,
they might show a little more, but it's not vulgar in any shape or form. I
can't tell you about it now, it's all classified. But you will see when they
are published, there's no need to be worried. It will be beautiful mom, I will
make sure of it."

"Okay, I trust you. Thank you for telling us."

"Always mom."

## Chapter Three
The flight had been long and we were a bit struck by the heat when we landed.
We rented a car and after a short trip we ended up in one of the best hotels we
had ever been in. In stead of an ugly high rise, these were all loose cabins
and close to the beach. There was a swimming pool, a good restaurant and even a
small bar where you could get every single kind of cocktail you wanted. I got
myself a fake Hawaiian bikini, including fake grass skirt.

When I first came out of the bedroom Travis took some photos of me in it. I
still wore the flowers we had received at the airport when they welcomed us to
the islands. We went exploring the retreat a little and I squealed when I saw
they had a spa. "I want to go there," I said with high voice, "Oh, I can feel
the mask already. So relaxing as they work on my nails. Um, if they weren't
closed right now I would make an appointment."

One of the girls behind the desk in the lobby had clearly heard me as she said
"Oh, I can schedule you in miss. Not a problem." I waved her away "I can't
right now. Busy schedule tomorrow, but thanks." She smiled and went back to
whatever she was doing.

We had a lovely dinner with a view over the ocean. It was all just so
beautiful, that night my husband got lucky while I was still wearing that
bikini and a big flower in my hair.

The next day was the day of the shoot and I felt a little anxious about it. The
car was filled with all kinds of equipment we had rented for the shoot. As it
still was quite early it was very quiet on the road. We arrived a little early
and I walked around to see locations where I wanted to shoot. It was a
beautiful house and a very beautiful location. We had access to a pristine
private beach, the house and everything that surrounded it. I gasped when I
noticed there even was a waterfall we could use. All kinds of ideas popped up
in my head.

I took some test photos, set up the lighting in the house and as I was working
Sophia arrived with two suitcases full of clothes she could wear. I showed her
the locations I had selected and she was more than happy with them.

"Isn't Dave coming?"

"Oh no, it's just you and me. I noticed Travis was here too. Would he mind
spending the day somewhere else? I've arranged for some girls to come and help
us. The whole idea was to have an all female shoot."

"Oh I think he doesn't mind at all. He was thinking about going fishing and
this would be a perfect excuse."

Travis didn't know how quick he could go and even thanked me. Not long after he
had left the other girls arrived. They helped me setup, did Sophia's hair and
makeup and we started the shoot. Inside at first. A series of her coming down
the stairs, elegantly dressed in a white dress. Then a series of her sitting on
the couch, looking outside, some of her in the kitchen with a glass of wine.

It was so much fun working with all those women. I even took some photos of the
others. "Maybe we could take one of me with some of them, like friends
visiting." I thought it was a great idea and we made it fun, so the laughes and
smiles were real

others. "Maybe we could take one of me with some of them, like friends
visiting." I thought it was a great idea and we made it fun, so the laughter
and smiles were real.

Then Sophia changed into a new outfit and we went outside. I told her how to
pose. "Now look straight into the lens. Look serious, yes like that. Now put
you right had on the strap and hold hit with two fingers, like you are about to
pull it down. Yes, just like that. Yes, yes, good. Nice. A little further, show
us that beautiful shoulder. Oh yes, yes, that's it." I looked up at here and
asked "Are you ready?"

Sophia nodded and said "I was ready yesterday. Let's do it." One of the girls
unzipped her dress and photo after photo Sophia showed a little more of her,
until finally the dress rested on her hips and she covered her breasts with her
arm. On the next photo she turned around towards the see and let her arms rest
normally, that was my very first topless photo. She looked almost regal even if
she was topless. The next photos were of here wearing only a thong.

Then we had a break for lunch and we all just had a good time. It felt so good
being amongst all women. For the last series Sophia changed into a bikini and
we went to the garden with the water fall. Sophia stepped into the water and I
started shooting. "Just have some fun with the water," I said and she did
deliver. Photo after photo she got more and more wet. She even stepped into the
falling water and I kept shooting. Finally she took of her top and went
underneath the water. I took a series of her coming op and swooping her long
hair backwards. When I checked them on my laptop they were all just magical, as
if she was a mermaid rising up from the sea.

As it got darker we were cleaning up. I saw the light in the sky and asked if
she wanted to do one more series. We walked up to the beach, to where the ocean
came up on the sand. Sophia immediately knew what to do. She undressed and laid
down in the wet sand. This time she was completely naked. I took a series of
photos of her in the sand, in some of them she even stared straight into the
camera. This session wasn't planned it just seemed right to do as the light was
just perfect.

In the end it was just Sophia and me left as we waited for Travis to come pick
me up. "Try this on," she said as she handed me that white dress she had worn
in the first shoot.

"Oh I can't," I protested, "this won't fit me."

"Bull, it's one-size-fits-all. Just try it on already."

I went into the bathroom and changed into that beautiful dress. I had never
worn anything like this. The dress had a gap in front clearly showing my
cleavage. The dress was so tight it showed all my curves. The moment I stepped
out of the bathroom Sophia took a picture of me. She looked at the small screen
on the back of the camera and said "Wow, you look so good in a photo. Come
here, stand over there." She gave me some instructions on how to stand and I
had some fun posing for her.

"Now," she said, "show me some more. Pull down your top and show me what you
got."

"Oh I can't."

"Who is here to see it? And this is your camera."

"Yes but --"

"Think about the surprise for Travis. Some photos of his wife like this."

I thought about it for a while, laughed and loosened the straps, ever so slow I
pulled the bodice down until with one flash of the camera a photo of me
exposing my breasts was made. I pulled everything up right after and started to
giggle. "Wow," Sophia said, "You should really think about modeling. I really
think it would sell."

I changed into my own clothes again and handed Sophia the dress. "Oh, keep it.
It looked way better on you than it did on me. I hardly ever wear it. It's a
gift."

"Oh I can't accept this."

"Sure, you can and I see some headlights coming. It's too late anyway. My
suitcases are in my car already. Come let me help you pack so we can get out of
here. I had the best day, can't wait to see the results."

That evening it was just a little to warm for me to sleep and I still felt the
rush of the shoot so I decided to work on the photos a little. Just to make a
first selection. When I came around to the photos of me in that dress it
shocked me a little. The photos were alright, lighting could have been better
but what shocked me was how good I looked in that dress, how I seemed to pop
out of the photo. I just couldn't believe that Sophia had been right.

Just as I came around to the topless one Travis leaned over my shoulder. "Is
that my wife? Wow, she looks hot. Is that the dress she gave you?" I nodded
"Wow, nice gift," he said and before I realized he pressed the arrow key to go
forward. The photo of me topless appeared on the screen. I felt so embarrassed
that I wanted to close the laptop. "Oh no, I want to see that one. Wow, did you
really -- just wow."

"It was just Sophia and me, I don't know what came over me, it just happened."

"No, it's beautiful. I love it. Wow, if I didn't know better I would show this
to everyone. Look this is my wife, I would say."

"Funny, the series is called that."

"Really? I didn't know." Travis replied veining it.

"Do you really like it?"

"Yes, it's so nice. You should be so proud, I know I am."

"But, I'm topless."

"Even better, I wouldn't mind seeing more of those."

"But you have the real deal sitting right here."

"I know, but it's so nice to see those photos. I don't mind sharing you with
the world. I've told you that once before, remember? When we tried that thing
in the bar?"

"Oh yes, almost forgot about that."

"We've had a lot of changes the past year. But I haven't changed my mind. If
you still have that fantasy, I'm not opposed. I've seen how you enjoyed the men
checking you out in that bikini. You even added a little more bounce to your
step."

"I did? Really? I didn't realize."

"Oh yes you did. Just to make those mamas bounce a little more. You loved the
attention you got and the best thing is that you didn't even realize that you
did it. That makes it even more attractive."

"Wow, I didn't know men were that shallow."

"Oh we are," Travis replied, "We don't need to get to know a woman. Are you
kidding? If you offer we take. That's just the way it is."

"Really? But doesn't it have to mean something?"

"Why? It's just sex."

"Just sex? What about intimacy? Love?"

"That's why I married you. But before? I couldn't care less. Until I met you.
From the moment I met you I wanted to take it slow. I wanted it to mean
something for the both of us. That's why I did what I did back then. I wanted
more from you, I wanted to love you and you to love me. I wanted this what we
have to mean something. And when you said yes, I was and still am the luckiest
man alive. Because I get to spend my life with you."

I hugged him and whispered "Guess who is getting to be lucky right now."
