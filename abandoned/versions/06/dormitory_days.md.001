# Dormitory Days
_an erotic tale by TransGirl_

## Chapter One
In high school I was one of the gray mice that roamed the hallways and I
preferred it that way. And although I didn't belong to any of the groups during
my high school years I had my share of friends. I wasn't very interested in
going to parties or going to games. I preferred being at home with my computer
and the internet. Most of my friends were on there as I was part of an online
community playing Dungeons and Dragons.

Although it might have been on a distance, some of the people online knew me
better than anyone closer to me. My mother quite often said I needed to get out
more and make some friends until I finally gave in and joined the school
newspaper. We met after school two times a week and wrote dumb articles about
whether the lockers needed to be replaced. An article about the metal detectors
creating a false sense of safety was declined by the school. Being part of the
newspaper did spark my interest in journalism and I applied to a college in
journalism in my senior year.

Durint that summer break I worked at my father's store to earn some money
before I went to college. I worked full days and did my best not to spend any
of it. As I worked all day the summer went by quickly and the day I moved out
arrived fast. My mother had a hard time that day, she was very emotional all
day. "Oh please mom, stop crying. I'm not dead, I will be back during the
holidays and breaks." I said. She hugged me and I joined my dad in the car to
drive to my new home, the dorms of college.

After a three hour drive we arrived and I registered myself at the table with
the _new admissions_ sign. The woman behind the desk handed me my badge and the
key to my assigned room "Ah," she said, "your room mate has already arrived, so
it's nice for the both of you to meet." Instantly I got nervous, sure I had
know I was to meet new people but I hadn't realized I actually would share a
room with one. My father walked with me to my new room and saw that the door
was open. As I walked in my room mate was busy putting away her clothes.

"Hi," I said, "I'm Luna, your room mate?"

"Ah," she replied, her long blonde hair waved as she turned to me, "I'm Summer,
pleased to meet you. Oh, I already chose a bed, hope you don't mind. I'm used
to having my bed to the left of the room, we can switch if you really want to."

"That's fine," I replied, "I don't really care. What's your major?"

"Audio Visual, I want to be a photographer." she replied, "and yours?"

"Journalism, I like to tell stories."

"Ah, maybe I could shoot some pictures to your stories. Or we could work on a
story together one day."

My father said he had to leave and after a last hug he walked out the door, he
had insisted I staid in my room. "Maybe we could explore campus for a bit,"
Summer suggested. I dropped the bag I was holding "I thought you'd never ask."

We went down to the lobby where there were a lot of people signing in and
searching for something. Summer and I walked outside onto the central plaza. In
the middle was a large tree with benches around it. The grass around it was
littered with groups of people chatting and enjoying the sun. We walked around
the plaza, found the buildings where our classes would be and finally the
library. Next to the library was a coffee shop and we sat down on the patio,
Summer got us two latte's and we just sat there chatting.

She was very easy to get along with and I was hoping she was thinking the same
about me. When we finished our drinks we strolled along the other side of the
plaza where there was a pizza place, a Mexican restaurant and a small
supermarket. Finally there was the dining hall, on the sign near the entrance
was a sign stating _Welcome first year students! For 30 dollars a month you can
get one free lunch or dinner a day. Subscribe for your cheap meals now!_ A boy,
clearly a senior, said "That's a really good deal, trust me. You might want to
sign up for that." We thanked him for the information and walked in to sign up,
the money would be withdrawn automatically each month.

After about an hour we walked back to our room and I continued unpacking my
bags. Summer talked about a hundred words a minute as I did and I just enjoyed
her company. She was totally different from me in every sense of the word. As I
was unpacking she said "What? No dresses, skirts or sexy shirts? Are you even a
girl? I've never seen someone with so many pants. I really need to teach you
some fashion sense." I tried to protest but she interrupted with a "Challenge
accepted!" She smiled and walked away.

The next day was orientation day, we spent all day roaming the halls going from
introduction class to orientation class, I couldn't remember half of the
professor's names. The list of books I needed to get just kept on growing. At
the end of the day there was a full page of titles in my notepad. During lunch
I met Summer in the dining hall and she had the same amount of titles in her
notepad. "Let's get them together," she said, "but it can wait until tomorrow.
This afternoon is the extra curricular market, we can join a fraternity or a
club or anything else. Let's just enjoy our last day of freedom."

That afternoon we went from stall to stall and there wasn't anything that
peeked my interest until I came across a stand with a sign I recognized
_Treadmill RPG_. I had heard of them online and walked over. Behind the stand
stood Trevor. "Hi, interested in RPG? That stands for --"

"Role Playing Games, yes I know." I interrupted him.

"Ah," he said, "you played before."

"Yes, I'm a member of the _Mildew Guild_."

"The Mildew Guild? Oh man, you guys rock. That last raid you did? Man, pure
elegance. Especially that one action, the way she mislead that hag, legendary."

"Ah," I replied, "spur of the moment. I was just lucky with the dice."

"That was you? My god. You want to join us? It would be our honor to call you a
member."

"I'll think about it. It would mean I have to leave Mildew."

"No it wouldn't. We only play once a month and can easily change it to
accommodate you."

"Again I will thing about it. Thanks."

As I walked back to Summer she said "You're not thinking about joining the
geeks are you?"

"I'm thinking about it. I love playing Dungeons and Dragons and I am a member
of one of the leading guilds now. But they are all on the internet and my
mother always said I need to get out and meet people."

Summer laughed "Never got the lure of it. You're just playing a game."

"Oh, it's more than just a game. You know what? I'm joining them and when you
want to you can join us sometime, just to sit in and see what it's all about.
Yeah, hold on I will be right back." I walked back to the stand and joined
Treadmill. Trevor was elated and said the first session would be in two weeks.

Summer laughed when I returned "Never saw anyone so happy by joining the geek
squad. I love it."

We browsed the other stands and Summer joined the photography club and although
there were fraternities doing their best to get us to join we both resisted.
"My mother warned me against it," Summer said, "she was part of one and always
told me how great it was. It just made me not want to join one, ever." We
strolled the marked for a while and Summer joined the photography club, just
for giggles as she said it.

During the next few weeks we got settled in, started our classes and did our
best to find a rhythm between school, studying and the things we did next to
school. One of the things Summer did was going to study in the library. "Then
I'm near the books I need anyway." was her explanation. It was rather nice to
be able to study on my own and sometimes with a study group that I joined.

For one of my classes we needed to write an article about anything school
related, a so called human interest article. I decided to do one about the head
of the dining room. She was an Iranian refugee with a very interesting story.
She had fled her country when the Christians started to get persecuted.
Especially the part where some of the students called her a Muslim terrorist
when they didn't get their ways. I had asked Summer to take some photo's of
her, the article almost wrote itself and I got an A+ for it, thanks to the
photo's of Summer who used the photo's for her portrait classes.

The more time we spent together the closer we got, after a few months some
would call us best friends even. During the weekends we would go out to eat or
go shopping. She started to buy me things and when I asked how she could afford
it all she just waved it away. "I've gotten a good job," she said, "Don't worry
about it." I started to get concerned she was doing something she might regret
or illegal even so one evening I decided to press through.

"Summer, I'm worried," I said, "You're gone almost every night, you take some
very sexy dresses with you and do not come back until late. I just want to know
you're not doing something stupid."

"It's nothing," she protested, "don't worry about it."

"Too late," I replied, "I'm already worried. Do you even study anymore? I've
heard you've fallen asleep during classes. What's going on Summer?"

Summer sighed deeply and said "It's not what you think. I'm not a prostitute.
It's --"

"It's what?"

"Maybe I can better show you." she said and just looked at me with these sad
eyes. She got her laptop from her bag and put it on my desk. She opened it up
and opened a website, called _CamGirls_. "This is what I'm doing," she said,
"it's a website where you sit in front of the camera and do challenges. Some
nights I get over 5000 coins, which translates to almost 500 dollars."

"What? Where do you do these _challenges_?"

"Anywhere, mostly in the library."

"What?! You have to be joking. Are you crazy? What if you get caught?"

"That's what's so exciting about it. It's the adrenaline as well as the money."

"Oh my God Summer. Is that what you are doing every night?"

"Yes, it's just so -- addicting. Every day I tell myself not to do it that
evening, but during the day I get the itch and then just have to go."

I sat down, not believing what I just had heard. Summer begged me to not tell
anyone, to keep it between us and I looked at her. "Only if you promise me to
slow down. The more you do it, the bigger the chance you get caught." Summer
nodded and whispered "Will you help me with it?"

"Just tell me when you get that _itch_ and I will find something to do for us."
I promised her and we hugged. Summer thanked me and we went off campus to get
something to drink. Summer talked about what the site was all about, she also
told me how many girls were on there doing the same thing she did. Some did it
at home, others just like Summer in public.

"It all started when I talked to an old friend of mine," Summer explained, "She
was doing this and told me how much money she earned. She earns more in one
night then I did in a week. I know that's no excuse, but I come from a poor
family. I'm the first to go to college, ever. The scholarship I got is hardly
enough to pay for everything and the job at the restaurant hardly made me
anything. And the customers were just rude at some times, I got so sick of
waiting tables."

She looked down and continued "Then one evening I was in the library studying
and I remembered the story I was told. I opened the site and registered an
account. As I sat at a rather secluded area of the library I went live for the
first time. It didn't take long for the first people to show up. One of them
offered 500 coins to flash my boobs. I looked around a few times, got up and
checked if anyone was close, sat down and flashed them. Just by doing that I
had made 50 dollars. Then someone else offered double if I kept them out for a
full minute and I did. In just 10 minutes I had made more than I ever could
with waiting tables. I wrote it was my first time on a piece of paper held it
up and promised I would be back soon."

"Weren't you scared?"

"Yes, but that's part of the rush. The risk of getting caught."

"But if you do get caught, you will get expelled Summer. You have to be
careful."

"I know, that's why I don't do it at the library on campus. I go to the library
downtown. Not only is it bigger, it has spots where hardly anyone goes on the
times I go there."

"But the library closes at nine, where do you go then?"

"Anywhere else. I've been to bars, coffee shops, malls."

"Oh my God, Summer. This is unbelievable."

I sat down and was quiet for a while, then I said "I want to write a story
about this. From your point of view. From the girls who choose to do something
like this. Why they do it and such."

"You can't use my name, though."

"I promise."

Summer agreed and logged into the site. She went to a section that wasn't
available for the general public, it was meant for what the site called
_performers_. She left a message that a friend of hers wanted to write a story
about cam girls, to tell the story from their point of view. She asked for
anyone who was interested to contact her.

"And now we wait," she said.
